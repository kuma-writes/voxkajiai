I've been a long-time fan of audible books. Well, for me long-time goes back about eight years. That's when I started borrowing books on tape from the school library and listening to them on my 15 minute commute to and from work. It takes a long time to get through an unabridged book with only 25-30 minutes per day, but I really enjoyed it. I've "read" more books this way than I've been able to get through with bedtime reading, not including all the books I read to my son up until he started 6th grade.

Nevertheless, when I moved back to the states one of the first things I did was sign up for an [Audible.com](https://audible.com) subscription. It seemed like a great way to get an mp3 player as well as pick up at least a book a month. Things went well for three years and my Audible Otis continued to serve its purpose through several Audible updates (there was one update along the way that was problematic). Last year Audible wanted to forcibly change its subscription options, so I finally bowed to pressure in order to pick up a free iPod Shuffle and switched to their new terms. Now, I can't wait for my 1 year commitment to end.

The problem is not with Audible. The problem is that I finally discovered podcasting, and my books-on-tape "reading" has taken a nosedive.
