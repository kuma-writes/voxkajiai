Amazon may have just knocked it out of the park, or at least hit a triple, for me in terms of deciding on an e-reader. They’ve announced the “[Kindle Owners’ Lending Library](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_357575542_1?ie=UTF8&docId=1000739811&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=gateway-center-column&pf_rd_r=1VYVFBR28CRDDPQX8VYY&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1328834582&pf_rd_i=507846),” a book-a-month lending program for Amazon Prime Kindle Owners.

I don’t know how long it will take its competitors to offer an alternative, but I’ve been on the fence, looking at the Kindle Fire, the B&N Nook, and the new Kobo Vox. This news may have pushed me off the fence. Amazon already has me in their music, video and shopping ecosystem, so going all in with ebooks seems to be a no-brainer at this point.

Still, I need to look into the details a bit more. I wonder what this means, if anything, for libraries, both public and school-based?
