I recently was asked to recommend iPhone apps for studying Japanese. In truth, I haven't really yet used the iPhone or iPod Touch to study Japanese, but have used my DS. So, it was a good question, and one that encouraged me to seek out some of the top apps through a variety of source. These are the 10 that I have been able to find recommended or ranked well. Many of them are paid applications and they all tend to fall into either the dictionary or flashcard category, but most if not all have the ability to customize one's study.

These are not in any particular order:

1. Human Japanese (Lite/Free version also available) 
2. Pocket Japanese (many variations, tied to the JapanesePod101.com website)
3. Kanji (from Lima Sky)  
4. Japanese (a dictionary tool from Code From Tokyo) 
5. Kotoba  (FREE!) 
6. Japanese Flip  
7. Japanese 101: Giongo Gitaigo  
8. Japanese Phrases and Lessons  
9. ShinKanji  
10. KanjiBox

Now to determine which ones are worth purchasing to try myself.
