A colleague shared a link to a recent Nicolas Carr blog posting entitled, “[Utopia is creepy](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2011/10/utopia_is_creep.php).” In his posting, Carr is critical of the increasing number of futuristic videos created by tech companies.

> The productions are intended to present us with visions of technological Edens, but they end up doing the exact opposite: portraying a future world that feels cold, mechanical, and repellent.

Nicholas Carr has been stirring the pot for a number of years now, perhaps most famously on the topic, “Does IT Matter,” and more recently with his book _The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains_, on how the Internet is rewiring (rotting?) our brains.

In his blog posting, I think Carr makes some valid points about these videos, but futurists have been imagining utopias and dystopias for centuries, and by the nature of the endgame, they must be as sterile and perfect, or as harsh and hellish as can be. Describing our modern world of medical advances, wireless communication, miniaturization, etc. to people 100 or 200 hundred years ago, the future would have seemed as far-fetched, magical or blasphemous (depending on your POV) as some of the videos are today. We can only envision the future through the lens of our present understanding of the world, which is why I think these visions tread into the _uncanny valley_ (familiar yet foreign).

Carr may be repelled by the packaging of these visions, but I view the packaging in the same way I view most TV shows that feature perfect people living fantasy lives--as fantasies. However, I DO like to imagine the various applications of technology that I see in these videos. For me, my criticism or cynicism is not about the packaging, but about the degree to which commercial/government interests, or even valid security/privacy concerns, will prevent these visions from becoming a reality.

What do you think? Are the videos cold or sterile? Too minimalistic? Too fantastic?

I [blogged about Corning’s video](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/154/) a couple of months ago.

Microsoft has a [series](http://www.youtube.com/user/officevideos) of these videos, including the first one below that Carr references:

Here’s a vision of screens, with some elements that we see other places, too.
