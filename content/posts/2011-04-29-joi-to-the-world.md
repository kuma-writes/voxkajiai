If you haven’t heard the news, Joi Ito has been named the new Executive Director of the MIT Media Lab ([Joining the MIT Media Lab](http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2011/04/25/joining-the-mit.html)). This is really pretty cool news. It is interesting, too, since he’s being asked to lead an important division of an Ivy League institution, even though he dropped out of two universities and never receiving a degree himself.

If you are still scratching your head wondering who Joi Ito is, think Mozilla, Creative Commons, Tucows, Twitter, Flickr, Six Apart, Technorati, Last.fm, and more. He’s had a hand in all of them, either directly or indirectly as an investor ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi\_Ito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito)).

I’ve been reading and following Ito for several years, in magazines, on Twitter and online in other outlets. Is it sad or just representative of my Japanophilia that [Guy Kawasaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki), [John Maeda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda), and Joi Ito are some of the first people who come to mind when I think of interesting and inspirational leaders in the tech world (Yes, I know that Ito is the only native Japanese of the three, and that Kawasaki and Maeda are both American). Nevertheless, I am as interested in Ito’s appointment as I was when John Maeda took the reins as President of the Rhode Island School of Design.

My particular interest in Ito, though, is his role as leading advocate for the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/), [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) and for the sharing economy in general. In academia, one of the biggest challenges we have in preserving, creating and advancing intellectual discourse in the 21st century is dealing with the issues of copyright, ownership, rights management and the like.

Libraries are prevented from preserving our film and photo heritage because copyright issues prevent them from transferring content to new formats. Our history is literally rotting away in cans and we are helpless to preserve it.

Students create academic research projects for courses using images, sound and video and cannot share them outside of the class, or run the risk of having their work silenced or removed under the scythe of overly broad takedown notices. The DMCA makes students, faculty and academic staff feel like criminals just for the act of excerpting video from DVDs for commentary and intellectual discussion.

Our current copyright and patent system is broken and is in great need of revision that benefits the society at large and not just the corporations who are writing the laws through their lobbying efforts. Much more can be written on the subject certainly, but I’ll stop for now.

Suffice it to say that MIT has been at the forefront of the open education movement for years, so I am greatly pleased to see Joi Ito come on board at the MIT Media Lab. I wish him great success, and I hope I have the opportunity to interact with him at some point in the near future.
