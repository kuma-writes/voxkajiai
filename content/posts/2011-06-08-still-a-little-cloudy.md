At the WWDC this week, along with talking about iOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion, Apple did unveil the basics of its forthcoming iCloud service offerings. Unfortunately, it was not the service that many of us long-time Apple devotees were hoping for. Rather than a service enhancement, for those who have been MobileMe users throughout its many incarnations (iTools, .Mac, etc.), iCloud represents more of a service reduction or outright elimination. And even with Apple’s offer to extend MobileMe subscriptions for free until June 2012, many who just renewed prior to the announcement feel betrayed and cheated.

Everyone acknowledges that MobileMe has had its share of problems. (Apple even lost over a year of my mail in a server outage a few years back.) MobileMe has been the butt of many jokes, and many wonder why anyone would pay $99/year for services that can be had for free elsewhere. With so many free services vanishing from the Internet, however, a paid service from Apple offering web hosting, image and file sharing, hardware tracking, cloud storage, e-mail, contacts, calendaring and PIM and third-party synching seemed like a reliable, reasonable service offering that would be around for a while.

And now, Apple has pulled the carpet out from under us once again. Loving Apple is like being in an abusive relationship--they limit you, they tell you exactly what they want you to do, and they will constantly keep you on edge with their unpredictability, but they keep you coming back for more. I realize this is not exclusive to Apple, but they do it with such a particular style.

With iCloud, gone is the 20GB of iDisk storage. Gone are the photo and video galleries linked from iPhoto albums and iMovie. Gone are the iWeb-built hosted web sites. Gone, too, is the $99/year price tag.

What remains? Well, e-mail, contacts, calendaring will still sync, but it is unclear whether or not they will be accessible via the web if you are away from your devices. It is also unclear whether third-party apps that sync through MobileMe will still be able to sync.

The iCloud will allow for automatic daily backup of iOS devices, but I find it comical that Apple is only offering 5GB of storage now when none of their iOS devices have anything less than 8GB of storage capacity. That 5GB allowance is also supposed to be used for mail and documents, too. This makes things even more hilariously disappointing for those who have had 20GB available to us. My e-mail archive alone is close to 2GB.

That iCloud will expand my music sync’ing across up to 10 devices seems like a good thing, but it is limited to only iTunes-purchased music, unless I go for the iTunes Match service. The Match service, for $25/year will allow me to match music in my collection with that stored in Apple iTunes Music Store, and then sync those songs to all my devices. Is that a good service? I guess it depends on how you acquire music.

If you acquire music legally through other non-iTunes sources, you are effectively paying $25/year for the privilege of pushing those songs to all your devices through the iCloud. But, if you’ve acquired your music through less than legal means, you are effectively paying a $25/year fee for music amnesty. Seems like a boon to pirates, but less than ideal for legal acquisitions purchased through Amazon or other music services.

In total, I have to say that this is probably the least impressed I’ve ever been by a significant Apple announcement, and it still doesn’t fully address my music sharing and distribution needs. For me, all in all, things are still cloudy, and I must admit, Apple has actually rained on my MobileMe parade.
