__INGREDIENTS:__

STOCK:

* 1 whole fryer chicken cut up or 6 thighs or 4 breasts
* 3½ quarts water (enough to cook chicken in)
* 2 stalks celery
* 1 small onion, quartered
* ½ cup butter or margarine
* 1 tbsp salt
* Dash or two of pepper
* 1 tsp poultry seasoning
* 2-3 cans chicken broth if needed
* a few drops yellow food coloring

DUMPLINGS:

* 2 cups  sifted all purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* ⅓ cup  shortening
* 5-7 tbsp ice water (a little more if needed)

__PREPARATION:__

1. Place chicken in a large stockpot or dutch oven. Cover with water. Add the onion, celery, butter and 1 tbsp salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. 
2. Cook chicken 45 min to 1 hour or until chicken is falling off of or pulls away from bone easily with a fork. 
3. Remove chicken from pan and let cool. Discard skin and bones. 
4. Skim large fat off of top of stock. Don't worry about the little pieces of fat because they will melt  away with further cooking. 
5. Cut or tear up chicken and return to stock.
6. In a large bowl, sift flour (or use pre-sifted flour), and the tsp salt. 
7. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 
8. Stir in ice water until mixture starts to hold together where you can form a ball. 
9. Divide dough in half and shape into 2 balls. (It's easier to work with 2 but you can just do as one ball.)
10. On a lightly floured surface (wax paper, pastry sheet or even just your countertop), roll the ball of dough to about ⅛ inch thick. It should be very thin. 
11. Cut into 1 inch strips or squares. (They don't have to be perfect or exactly an inch, just cut them however you want.)
12. Bring stock back to a boil and add a couple of cans of chicken broth. (The broth has to be several inches above the chicken for the dumplings to have enough room to cook and remember the dumplings will absorb some of the broth.) 
13. Reduce heat to low boil. 
14. Drop dumplings a few at a time into simmering broth. (If you boil them too high, the dumplings will disappear or clump together.) 
15. Let cook about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the dumplings and chicken from sticking to bottom of pan. 
16. Add the poultry seasoning and then salt and pepper to taste.  
17. Optionally: Add a few drops of yellow food coloring if you want the broth and dumplings to have a slight yellow tint. (Usually if you cook chicken with skin on it makes the broth yellow and give it a better flavor. You can remove the skin after cooking.) 
18. When done, remove pan from heat and let rest about 10 minutes. Granny said sometimes she would add  a little milk  like a ⅓ cup after they were done. I have done it with and without. It’s fine either way.
19. Note: I don't like my broth to be too soupy once the dumplings are added  but I don't like it real thick either so I usually add a can of chicken broth. It also depends on how much you lose during the process of cooking the chicken.  Experiment. Have fun. If you only have skinless chicken on hand, the broth wont have as much flavor. As a solution, just add a can of Healthy Request Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup and it will fix the problem.
