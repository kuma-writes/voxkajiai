As mentioned in [part 1](http://localhost/portable-php/portable.php#2021-09-29-saturday-mornings-in-the-70s-part-1), the other duo who influenced my childhood and Saturday mornings were [Sid & Marty Krofft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_and_Marty_Krofft). And, like [Hanna-Barbera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna-Barbera), their works existed for several years before I was a regular consumer, but would have an unknowable connection to my future as well.

While [*The Banana Splits*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banana_Splits) was the first series in production, in 1968, I feel fairly strongly that the first Krofft production to come across my toddler eyes was [*H. R. Pufnstuf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Pufnstuf). Who can say with absolute certainty how things are ordered in the memory of a 2-3 year old mind? Perhaps it is the case that I simply have more deeply ingrained memories of *The Banana Splits* in syndication, and a clear recollection of its decline from a 60 minute syndicated show to a 30 minute show. But that *Pufnstuf* is simply an earlier pin on the mental timeline. The brain works in mysterious ways, but this is the order I'm sticking with!

*H. R. Pufnstuf* may be my earliest awareness of narrative television. Each episode told a story, there were a variety of characters, and there was a general delineation of good vs. evil. *The Banana Splits* was essentially a variety show, and [*Sesame Street*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street) and [*The Electric Company*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Company) were educational variety shows. And while the [*Looney Tunes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes) told stories, they were short and simply not the same as having real people in them. I'm no child development specialist and without research I can't say when a child's brain is able to differentiate between human and cartoon characters, but I have very different memory experiences of live-action and animated programs. I am convinced that one of the keys to the success of the Krofft programs was the blend of human and non-human (costumed) performers. I believe that provides a different connection within the mind of a child, in comparison to a purely animated program.

Another element that stands out in the Krofft universe is the presence of danger and menace. Danger and menace are hallmarks of mythology and fairytales. And, I think it is undeniable that many of the Krofft villains owe their characterizations to Margaret Hamilton's [Wicked Witch of the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_Witch_of_the_West) role in [*The Wizard of Oz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)), and some of the Disney villains, too. Undeniable, also, is that Pufnstuf is direct riff on *The Wizard of Oz*, and also probably one of the darkest of the Krofft shows. [*Lidsville*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidsville) clearly borrows from [*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland), so I'm not claiming anything particularly unique about the shows in this regard. [*Land of the Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lost_(1974_TV_series)) is a dark family drama with danger everywhere. [Jay Robinson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Robinson) [*Dr. Shrinker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Shrinker) is terrifying in many regards, helped along by assistant [Billy Barty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Barty). Even [*Sigmund and the Sea Monsters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_and_the_Sea_Monsters), while it has some slapstick moments, to lessen the Lovecraftian horror of the sea monsters, is always played with a straight face. [*Far Out Space Nuts*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Out_Space_Nuts) and [*The Lost Saucer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Saucer) were more farcical, the casting of [Bob Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Denver) and [Chuck McCann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_McCann), and [Jim Nabors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Nabors) and [Ruth Buzzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Buzzi)[^1], respectively, make that clear, but still involve dangerous elements.

Like the Hanna-Barbera works, the world of Sid & Marty Krofft may not have risen to the level of high art, and many may even dismiss the works as derivative pablum to rot kids minds, but I don't buy into it, even now in my 50s. Maybe it is more believable that these shows had a greater influence on my liberal ideology. After all, many of these shows featured diverse casts and told stories of working with people and creatures who were very different to overcome oppressive forces in the world. Many featured young people whose voices and actions mattered. In the era of Women's Lib, [*Electra Woman and Dyna Girl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_Woman_and_Dyna_Girl) were the only human superheroes in the Krofft pantheon. There was a lot of tolerance and an undying optimism in these morality tales. Unlike some of the animated shows of the 80s, though, I am of the opinion that the Krofft shows treated their audience with a bit more respect and with less sugar-coating. There's a message of perseverance even through hardship. That's why these shows have stayed with me for as long as they have, and why I'm glad to have grown up with them in the 1970s.

The Krofft limelight began to fade in the 1980s. But one prime-time show burrowed its way into my memory and may have contributed to my interest in Japan. On March 1, 1980, NBC debuted [*Pink Lady and Jeff*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Lady_(TV_series)), starring the Japanese megastar disco-pop idol duo [Pink Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Lady_(duo)). I have no idea why my family chose to watch, but we did and I never forgot about it when it disappeared after 5 episodes. It was bad, for many reasons that can be read on the Wikipedia page. Nevertheless, when I ended up in Japan on exchange 8 years later, I knew who Pink Lady were and it provided a connection between myself and my new Japanese friends. While Pink Lady were no longer chart toppers themselves, their musical legacy lives on still to this day, both in karaoke and in the numerous music programs that regular feature retrospective performances that never let musical memories fade.

Side notes:

1. I didn't mention [*The Bugaloos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bugaloos) above, but that show always held a very special attraction for me, perhaps because it seemed to go away too soon, or maybe it was the combination of music and story, like an even-more kid-friendly version of [*The Monkees*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees_(TV_series)), but maybe I just had a crush on [Caroline "Joy" Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Ellis) when it aired in syndication in 1978.

1. Sometimes, I was able to catch a replay of the [*Pufnstuf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pufnstuf_(film)) movie on a UHF station, too. I learned about [Cass Elliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Elliot) there first, and several years later became a fan of [The Mamas and Papas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mamas_%26_the_Papas). 

1. Kids today will never understand the anticipation and delayed gratification that was required before DVRs and everything-on-demand.
