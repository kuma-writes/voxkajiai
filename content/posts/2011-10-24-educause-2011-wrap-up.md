Another EDUCAUSE Conference has come and gone. This year was my first time back since 2008, but I must admit that I think this was one of the best I’ve attended. I believe it was a combination of factors that contributed to this. On the one hand, the economic malaise of the past several years has begun to lift so the mood itself was better. The session mix, too, was a good one (Thank you, Program Committee). For me, that means that there weren’t too many overlapping sessions and I actually had time to explore the vendor floor. Or maybe I was just lucky in that, with my new position in the library, I was able to choose a schedule that met my interest while still allowing me time to look around the show floor. Either way, I feel that the overall conference was a successful one for me professionally.

Some notes:

The opening keynote by [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/) was well-done from a presentation point of view. As a professional speaker, Godin was clearly “off book” and knew his material well. His slides were interesting visually and his message was one that I believe many in the audience were pleased to hear. I must agree with my colleague, [Josh Kim](http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/educause-day-1-observations), however, who faults Godin for not doing a bit more homework to connect the message more closely to the educationally-oriented audience. One could easily imagine Godin giving the same presentation at any number of other conferences with little effort beyond some drag-and-drop changes. During the Q&A session, an audience member asked Godin for his solution to the educational challenges our nation faces. While acknowledging that the issue is more complex than anything that he could suggest, his response was that we should send our children to public school during the school day, to participate in and support the community, and home-school our children the rest of the day, using every opportunity parents have to encourage their intellectual development. While a good answer, I think it lacked the inspirational insight many may have hoped for following the main presentation.

The Vendor Floor was big and nicely laid out. I appreciated the wide walking corridors. My memory of past events was more cramped. The only place where space was at a premium was in the area that was designated for poster sessions. New this year was Startup Alley, a place for up-and-coming ventures to pitch their wares. The company that caught my eye was [Kno](http://www.kno.com/home), a web and mobile app for e-textbooks. Kno offers over 100,000 textbook titles and supports PDFs as well. On an iPad, Kno then adds a number of tools for annotation, note taking, for 3D modeling of chemical structures. The texts can be purchased or rented. The notes can be read within the context of the page or can be read as a companion notebook format, with direct links back to the source page. Plus, the notes live in the Cloud so that they are accessible between devices, too.

Other notes from the floor:

- I enjoyed Google’s booth setup, which combined an “indoor” product area along with an “outdoor” fireside chat area for their demo workshops, complete with forest imagery and outdoor carpet. They gave away Chrome-based notebook computers at each workshop.
- The MoodleRooms exhibit was quite large, a testament to how many schools have chosen to move away from commercial LMS vendors.
- I was pleasantly surprised by Epson’s interactive short throw projectors, with both wall and table mounts. The latter allows for interactive tabletop collaboration without the investment in something like Microsoft’s Surface computer.
- iPads were everywhere throughout the Conference, in attendees hands and as top prizes in vendor raffle drawings.

In addition to corporate products on the show floor, it was nice to see other projects continuing to be developed at colleges and universities. [BiblioBouts](http://bibliobouts.org/) is an online game developed at the University of Michigan to help students learn the process of finding high quality information using library databases and other reference information. At the end of the game, students will have a high quality bibliography or list of research sources they can use for to complete the course assignment, as well as research skills they can continue to use throughout their college coursework.

Purdue returned to demo their [Hotseat](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/hotseat/) product, a backchannel aggregator to assist students with question and answer in a large classroom setting. It joins a bevy of tools on their [Studio Projects](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/) page, which includes [Jetpack](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/jetpack/) (for interactive learning), [Doubletake](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/doubletake/) (for video assignments), [Mixable](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/mixable/) (making academics social) and [Signals](http://www.itap.purdue.edu/studio/signals/) (an early intervention tool).

UCLA showed off and demonstrated their [MWF](http://mwf.ucla.edu/) (mobile web framework), a Javascript and CSS framework designed to make developing for mobile devices as easy as possible. Their guiding principles behind the framework are:

- Device Agnostic - The framework is compatible with any web-capable mobile device.
- Platform Independent - The framework can be used by applications written in any language and on any environment.
- Easy to Use - Developers write one set of semantic markup and the framework handles the rest.
- Easy to Deploy - The framework is lightweight and simple to deploy and maintain.

The platform is already in use on five UC campuses and three more are in development. There is an active community around the framework and they have hosted annual conferences and workshops. The demo was amazingly easy to follow and looked very easy to implement.

[Spencer Striker](https://plus.google.com/107728211164882151456/about) began developing [GameZombieTV](http://www.gamezombie.tv/) as part of his Master’s thesis at Indiana University in Bloomington. The video-game-oriented media site serves as the basis for the [Media Arts & Game Development degree program](http://www.uww.edu/cac/magd/) curriculum covering Video Production, Web Design and Programming, and New Media Marketing now being offered at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater.

Other highlights included a presentation by Lynda Weinman, of [Lynda.com](http://Lynda.com), who spoke on “The changing role of educators in the digital age,” and constituent group meetings for attendees interested in [Games and Learning](http://www.educause.edu/cg/gamesandlearning) and [Digital Signage](http://www.educause.edu/DigitalSignageConstituentGroup/233130).
