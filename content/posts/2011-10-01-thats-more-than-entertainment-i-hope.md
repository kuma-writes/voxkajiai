Our fall semester is off to a good start, and the number of reserve items for courses here in the media center continues to increase every year, both in individual items and in courses using video reserves content. More and more, though, I begin to wonder exactly how the content is being used. How much is used directly in class? How much is on reserve for students to view as part of research assignments? How much of the content are students expected to watch all the way through?

As I started to ponder these questions earlier in the week, I came to the conclusion that the best way to find out is to ask. So, with help from some colleagues in the library and our center for the advancement of learning, I’m going to attempt to survey the faculty at the end of the term.

The questions above should be fairly easy to answer, but I wonder also about the pedagogical decisions to use media in the course. Is the media being “read” as a text? Is the media being watched for some intercultural purpose? Is it being used to enhance or reinforce language skills? Is it being used as an instructional or tutorial video? Does the selected media demonstrate a particular technique of filmmaking or storytelling? Or is it merely being used to elicit some kind of emotional response from the students? What drives the decision to use a particular film or video in class?

These are the questions I’m not quite sure of when thinking about a survey. How can I design the questions such that faculty will feel comfortable responding? Will they respond? Will they respond honestly? Will they feel defensive? Have they even considered these questions for themselves?

Choosing media for a course should be no less important than choosing the texts, yet I cannot but wonder what’s driving the greater usage of media across the curriculum. Having a bit more insight into these choices may help us here in the library media center in turn help the faculty a bit more to achieve their teaching and learning goals.
