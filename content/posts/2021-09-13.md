As I wrote yesterday, my thinking about "lingering" was not originally based on film or videogames, but music. More specifically, music videos.

Since the dawn of MTV, music videos have been a ground-breaking medium for artistic expression, fusing the best of aural and visual elements to enhance the musical experience. Not only do they showcase the work of musical artists, they have become  the launch pad for directors, choreographers, actors, and dancers. And, they can simply be joy to watch.

The works of directors such as [Spike Jonze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Jonze), [Michel Godry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Gondry), [Chris Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cunningham), [Jonas Akerlund](http://www.jonasakerlund.com/music-videos/), and [John Landis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Landis) stand out even today.    While the work of directors like [Sophie Muller](https://prettybird.co/us/talent/creatives/sophie-muller/biography/), [Melina Matsoukas](https://www.instagram.com/msmelina/?hl=en), [Diane Martel](), [Megan Thompson](http://meganthompson.com/video), and [Hannah Lux Davis](http://www.hannahluxdavis.com/), continue to move the art forward.

Ok, so what is the connection to lingering? In the past couple of years I've begun to watch more dance music videos, especially those by KPop artists. Maybe because of the pandemic or for the joy of that comes from watching TikTok dance videos, or just for the sheer talent on display by artists who are able to sing and dance so well, but regardless of the reason, I've consumed more than I did in the past. 

What kills me though, are the non-stop cuts that have become the hallmark of the genre. It almost seems to be a competition to see who can include the most edits in three minutes. It is a visual assault that hearkens back to the [blipverts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blipvert) of episode one of the [Max Headroom](http://www.maxheadroom.com/index.php?title=Welcome_to_the_Max_Headroom_Chronicles!) television show. Sure, one can say that I'm just not hip enough to appreciate the new works, but I swear that isn't it. As someone who has done video editing, I have great respect for the work of the directors and editors. I'm not even sure how I would storyboard one of these videos to account for the all of the shots. 

What gets lost, however, is the work of the set designers, the costumers, and the lighting designers, not to mention the choreographers and the incredible dance performances of the artists and backup dancers. Thankfully, at least in the case of the KPop groups, they (or other professional choreographers) regularly release dance practice videos for fans to study. I understand, however, that many of the quick cuts may be purely artistic in their own right, with the popularity of multi-member KPop groups like [BLACKPINK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmHUn--16B90oW2L6FRR3A), [Shinee](https://www.youtube.com/user/SHINee), [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymaIzkXY8nQ&list=PL_Cqw69_m_yz4JcOfmZb2IDWwIuej1xfN), [Red Velvet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk9GmdlDTBfgGRb7vXeRMoQ), and more, the quick cuts provide more time on screen for each member, lest a single member's fans revolt and storm social media demanding boycotts or compensation.

But, gosh darnit, I want more time to linger over the work of all these talented individuals! I'm sure, though, that I'm just shaking my fist at the sky.

P.S. Here are some standout videos, cuts and all:

SHINee's ["Get the Treasure"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Qyk9IBI2s) combines cinematic quality, a narrative story, amazing visuals, and choreography, but with some time to linger.

SHINee member Taemin's ["Advice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQg4VCB3bYw) is a visual buffet with amazing sets, costumes, so much texture, and insane choreo, but still with reasonable time in the environment(s).

I like BLACKPINK, but ["How you like that"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjL9di-UIYc) and LISA's solo debut ["LALISA"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awkkyBH2zEo), while both gorgeous, are just shy of seizure-inducing with cuts coming faster than one per second along with a roller-coaster camera ride.
