Last year there was a bit of a brouhaha about libraries using Netflix streaming accounts to provide patrons with access to streaming media in the Library. For more information about that case you can read about it here:

FastCompany, **[Librarians Gone Wild: Violating Netflix Terms of Use!](http://www.fastcompany.com/1690069/librarians-take-advantage-of-netflix-in-violation-of-terms-of-use)** by David Zax, Mon Sep 20, 2010.

As much as I would love to see a Netflix-like service for institutions, there is one aspect about the market today that troubles me--long-term access. One of the great things about our library is that, for the most part, if we own something in our collection, it will always be available to our patrons. It may be temporarily loaned out, but we know when to expect it back. Only when something is lost and not replaced will something actually fall out of our collection.

Netflix, like Hulu and others, appears to have struck deals with the studios that own the movies, television programs, etc., that grant time-limited access to the studios’ video vaults. If Netflix and the studio fail to come to an agreement for renewing their contract, all of that content becomes unavailable. Some of the materials themselves become unavailable after a certain time explicitly as part of the agreements. There is no certainty about when or if that content will become available again. With some studios, such as HBO, streaming rights are withheld for even longer time periods so that the pay-channel can recycle it in their lineup for a while, then hand it off to other cable channel licensees, and then maybe, eventually, it will come to streaming services.

Faculty can’t teach with that kind of unknown variable, and I don’t blame them. That’s why libraries offer a reserves service to faculty. It helps to ensure that the materials will be available to patrons for the duration of the course, by more tightly controlling access with time and place limitations. Turning off access to course material in the middle of a term can be a significant, though not necessarily insurmountable, impediment to the curriculum. This is one reason, besides cost, that many libraries began acquiring VHS and then DVDs. Before costs dropped to make ownership viable, schools would rent films to be shown in class. Rental was not cheap, and the film would arrive and have to be sent back within a specific time frame. A lost or damage reel meant the next customer for that film could be out of luck.

Ownership has a real advantage that cannot be understated. Unfortunately, I feel that we are likely to see the industry begin to shift back to a lease-based model with digital content, both to grow their regular income streams and also as a hedge against piracy. I worry for our library and our institution if that becomes the case.

What are your thoughts about this?
