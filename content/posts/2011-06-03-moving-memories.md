I met my father when I was 9 years old. It was the summer of 1977, and my older siblings and I had flown back to Texas to spend the summer with him, as we lived with our mother and step-father in Pennsylvania at the time. It was my first airplane flight, but aside from that, there is little that I remember of that summer, except for the movies. After all, it was the summer of _Star Wars_. But that’s not really what this post is about. \[On a side note, we saw _The Deep_ and _Orca_ that summer, too.\]

We moved back to Texas in 1979, and for the remainder of my junior and senior high school days, I would periodically spend weekends with my dad and step-family. There were camping trips, and Friday nights spent at the police officers’ club, where my dad and his band played, and shopping at the mall, but more than that I often link my memories of time spent with my dad to the movies we would go out and watch as a family on those weekend nights.

Since there were my brother, my step-brother, my dad and me, male preferences dominated the selections. So, for example, _Alien_ and _Poltergeist_ were big hits for us. But, at the same time, _Coal Miner’s Daughter_ was enjoyed by everyone, including my step-mother. While subsequent re-viewings of the films have solidified the stories in my memory, there are these snippets of before or after exchanges with my family that fix the viewing experience itself in time and memory. Naturally, we would comment on how we enjoyed the movie, the quality of the special effects and on the parts that scared or shocked us the most, but we would also debate or discuss pieces of the story that never seemed to be sufficiently tied up and would ponder the likelihood of sequels.

What brought all of this to mind was the movie _Tron Legacy_. The original _Tron_ film came out in 1982, when I was 15. I went to see it with my dad, who would have been 41 or so at the time, and my younger step-brother. There is almost the same age difference between my dad and me as between me and my son, so it seems almost appropriate that I had the pleasure of taking my son to see _Tron Legacy_ when it came out last winter (note: the pleasure was more in spending time with my son). When we went, my son was just a year older that I was when the original came out. Coincidentally, too, the film is about fathers and sons and loss and redemption, themes which, thankfully, probably resonate more with me than with my son. But, this is not all about some kind of spooky similarities, but rather just a “it kind of hit me” moment.

It also made me think more about the impact of movies, on our memories. More specifically, the impact that “going to see a movie” has on our memories. Certainly, we know that news events delivered through our television (such as 9/11) can leave indelible imprints, but I want to believe that there is something more about the theater experience. Is it the place? The community experience? The richer, multi-sensory factors? Or the act of going?

Whatever it is, the experience for me sticks and lodges itself deeper into my mind than any home-viewing event does. I don’t know why, but if you name a movie, for every one that I’ve ever seen in a theater (and there have been MANY), I can probably recall some aspect about that experience, whether it was a free screening, a $1 bargain show, or a 3D spectacle.

Am I alone in this, or can you say the same?
