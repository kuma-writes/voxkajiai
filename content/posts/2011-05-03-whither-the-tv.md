For the first time in 20 years, television set ownership dropped from 98.9 percent to 96.7 percent, according to The Nielsen Company ([http://nyti.ms/ixHyhA](http://nyti.ms/ixHyhA)). In the New York Times article, Nielsen attributes the decline to poverty and technology. In the latter case, Nielsen may soon redefine a “television household” to include Internet video viewers. You can read all that and more in the article, but I find this interesting for a couple of reasons.

First, the poverty statistic is not particularly surprising, but worth addressing nonetheless. A few years ago, perhaps 7-8 years, it was time to buy a new TV. The “little” 19“ set was coming up short for connectivity and age. So, when Black Friday rolled around, we went shopping. Widescreen and HD sets were just starting to hit the mainstream market, but were still pricy. After all, I could get get a new 27” tube set for just over $100, whereas even a 19“ flat widescreen set, not even HD, was close to $300. That’s a lot of money for not much screen real estate. The wide aspect really makes a set feel small.

Fast forward a couple of years, and I found myself in line outside a Target store, again on Black Friday, finally thinking we could treat ourselves to an HD set...if we could get our hands on one. We did, but even our new 37” 1080i set cost over $600. Even then I thought to myself, the whole scale of what should be a “reasonable price” for the family TV had shifted dramatically upward. Add to that, the shift to digital, the difficulty of even picking up local stations by antenna in rural areas (I’m in a somewhat rural city and I can’t pickup over-the-air stations), the rising cost of even basic cable service, and it’s not hard to see that “free” entertainment now has quite a high cost barrier to entry.

That dovetails with something I don’t see mentioned in the article, televisions per household. Replacing one TV to go digital is somewhat understandable and affordable. Replacing more than one at once, hurts the wallet even more. Convergence devices, such as smart phones, make a lot more sense if you are cash strapped. They’ve become The One Ring an individual or family can actually afford.

Times, and screens, have certainly changed. When I was thirteen, my parents gave me a choice between an “adult” bicycle and a television. I think my siblings received similar offers, but I was the first to get a color TV in my room (they received b&w sets). But this was huge, and it had nothing to do with television. In fact, since the living room TV had a cable box (it wasn’t even cable, just a single channel premium service), there was hardly a compelling reason not to watch TV there. No, for me, the television was a necessity in order to connect it to first my Commodore VIC-20 computer, and later my Commodore 64. That little 13“ set no longer functioned primarily as a television. It was my gateway to a whole new world, but I’ll leave that to a later posting.

The important thing is that multiple television sets in the house reduced competition for screen time among family members. It also ended up sending most of us to our respective rooms more and more. The VHS began to shift that dynamic some. TiVo and other DVR shifted that even more. Laptops, tablets and smart phones have taken it to perhaps its current extreme. When I was thirteen, I was the first person in my house for whom the TV became a monitor. Now, in just about every room of the house, monitors have become the new TVs. But, it has also, oddly, brought us back together in one room, even if we all might be looking at our personal screens, while the main set provides a shared ”background“ noise.

Knowing that Nielsen has been tracking Internet usage for a number of years now, I’m actually quite surprised that they are just now considering redefining their “television household” terminology. That sounds so...I don’t know, quaint. I think the cord to that notion should have be cut several years ago.
