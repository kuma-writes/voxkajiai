\[This is the third part of the series I began last [Friday](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-1/ "Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots! (Part 1)"), describing how your academic librarians are fighting the fight to continue to provide you and all patrons with access to materials in new and old formats, and the challenges they face in regards to copyright law. The [second part](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-2/ "Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots! (Part 2)") appeared yesterday.\]

The third area where copyright law becomes a complicating factor for the efforts of librarians is in preservation.

Although books can have quite a long shelf life if maintained and treated well, things do happen. Libraries have been repairing, preserving and restoring their collections for years. Unfortunately, new technological formats appear to have much shorter shelf lives, but efforts to preserve them are often stymied by copyright or other law. Films (on celluloid), audio tape, and video tape are effectively disintegrating in their cans and boxes on shelves around the world, and librarians are helpless to act.

Usually the last best hope at preservation of these items relies on copying the material onto a newer film stock or, as is more often the best option today, copying the material to a new format, from analog to digital, from film to DVD, for example. The process would, necessarily, create a copy of the original--an act explicitly forbidden by copyright law. Copyright law does not permit this to be carried out without the permission of the copyright holder. Locating the the copyright holder itself can be a challenge with older materials. With newer material, such as DVDs, preserving a copy to another disc or digital file also violates the DMCA laws against circumventing DRM protection.

For years, many library activities have been governed by the rights of first-sale, allowing the owner of a good to do with it anything they wanted to do, short of violating the copyright on the content. Under the doctrine of first-sale, books could be loaned, sold, or rebound with no threat or limitations placed upon these activities. As we move to digital-only resources, the doctrine of first-sale is being subverted and replaced with licensing agreements, strictly limiting what a library may do with the material. I was surprised to learn that even books and other publications (non-digital items!) are starting to come wrapped with license agreements that supersede the doctrine of first-sale. These are no different from “click-through” agreements for software, which have been upheld in court, but which serious limit the rights of consumers.

With digital-only resources, who will preserve content and access to that content when the distributing companies and mechanisms disappear? One solution for scholarly journals is already in place and actively used by libraries at institutions around the world. The [LOCKSS](http://lockss.stanford.edu/lockss/Home) (Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) Alliance, “... is an international community initiative that provides libraries with digital preservation tools and support so that they can easily and inexpensively collect and preserve their own copies of authorized e-content.” LOCKSS is actually a partnership between libraries and publishers to preserve access to electronic journal resources should the publisher or their online services disappear.

Another service, like LOCKSS, is [Portico](http://www.portico.org/), which is also a digital preservation collaboration between publishers and librarians. According to their [website](http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/who-participates-in-portico/), Portico currently has 712 library participants, 128 publisher participant, and holds a collection of over 114,000 book and journal titles in its collection, and is closing in on 300 million preserved files.

These digital repositories offer only one solution to the problems of preservation, however, and further solutions both legal and practical will need to be found.

Our school, not unlike many others, are moving more and more resources and services into the cloud of the Internet. Even though so much information is available online, the service of libraries and librarians goes above and beyond the morass that is “the cloud.” Large amounts of the collective culture and history of the world are essentially still kept and maintained in libraries large and small across the planet. We need a reasonable approach to copyright that will to continue to support and train these knowledge workers so that they can continue to fight for the common good of us all.
