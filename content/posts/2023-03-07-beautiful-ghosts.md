```
They are gone 
From my life
So many loved ones
Parents
Grandparents
Aunts
Uncles
Friends who passed too soon

They still haunt my mind
My memories
Of them
They live 
There
These beautiful ghosts 

I see them
I hear them
They visit on their own
Or when I summon them 
Just as they were then
These beautiful ghosts

But
Not all ghosts are gone 
We all leave a trace
Of ourselves
On others
And they
On us 
These beautiful ghosts

We see them
We hear them 
They visit on their own
Or when we summon them 
Just as they were then
These beautiful ghosts

When fortune shines
In ones and zeros 
Or better still
In person
They appear
These beautiful ghosts
As they are now
Alive
For a moment
Until again 
They become
These beautiful ghosts

You are all
My beautiful ghosts
And I am grateful
