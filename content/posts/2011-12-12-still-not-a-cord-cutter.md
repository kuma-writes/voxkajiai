Just read this editorial post from the Streaming Media Xtra:

["Cord Cutting Easier Said Than Done"](http://www.streamingmedia.com/articles/editorial/featured-articles/cord-cutting-easier-said-than-done-commentary-79311.aspx)Â by Jose Castillo.

> There is also frustration directed at the multiple options we have for viewing and the total lack of integration between boxes and subscriptions. If we are going to cut the cord, it appears as though we will have to shave it off piece by piece.

I share a lot of Castillo's frustrations (remotes and cables included). Last summer I intended to cut the cord at home, only to bail when two other issues arose. The first was Comcast's decision to offer a new suite of alternative programming packages (the MyTV Choice bundles) in my area, which allowed me to scale back the number of channels in my cable lineup and save some money along with it. It's not quite a la cart yet, but certainly a step in the right direction. The "Get Started Plus" bundle comes close to an 80/20 solution. The second was that I then turned around and used the cost savings to buy monthly access to JapanTV, an overpriced, single-channel offering of news and entertainment programming from Japan. This has long been a request from my wife and the opportunity finally presented itself.

So, we still have been unable to cut the cord. Much is available freely online and through other services, such as Netflix and Hulu, but content and timeliness matter. Netflix's "contemporary" streaming offerings still feel anemic, many DVDs are delayed a month, and Hulu is delaying many new shows by a week at the request of studios and networks. While there is an abundant supply of people willing to post recordings on YouTube and a plethora of similar international services, one usually needs to watch quickly before the content owners file their takedown notices. I purposely avoid the torrent market these days, leaving few alternatives to watch content when and where I want it, unless I keep the cable connected and take advantage of the OnDemand service that that provides.

Still, that leaves me waiting until 2012 to watch HBO's adaptation of Game of Thrones, when the DVD set will be released and I can borrow it from my library.

The cord is still tough to cut.
