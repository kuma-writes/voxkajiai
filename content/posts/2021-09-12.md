Another birthday is notched on the staff of my life and I'm drawn to an idea that has occurred to me recently that makes me wonder if it is my age or something else that has me asking for more time to linger in my media consumption.

I remember when I was an undergraduate student some decades ago that it took me some time to get comfortable with the slow pacing of non-Hollywood films and Japanese literature (I was a TV/radio/film student minoring in Asian Studies). The first time I read a [Yukio Mishima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima) novel, [*Spring Snow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Snow), I couldn't finish it, but when I revisited it a few years later I thoroughly enjoyed it and then read my way through the rest of the [Sea of Fertility tetralogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_of_Fertility) and many more. 

In the 90s, [*Seinfeld*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) made a name for itself as the show about nothing, and yet in many Japanese films the viewer often feels much more like a voyeur dropping in on the lives of ordinary people where nothing and everything just kind of happens, slowly, as we watch, as we linger.

Then, there are those works of incredible world-building in some novels or literary series in which we lose ourselves and never want to leave, eagerly anticipating the next release to transport us back. In film, the artistry of a cinematographer can be breathtaking, overwhelming our senses in a way that has us catching our breath in wonder, especially when the director gives us time to savor it.

As a videogamer, I can look back at the games that I have played and truly enjoyed in a similar way. I grew up with Pong and Atari Video Console games, and dropped plenty of quarters into arcade game machines, and though they offered a way to pass the time, they didn't really offer me an escape the way that many adventure games did on my [VIC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20) or [C-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64). Then, with the 90s, we were able to really get pulled into other worlds with 3D first-person shooters (playing [*Marathon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_(video_game)) on my Mac with headphones was even more of an experience, but I digress). It was [*Myst*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst) that provided a film-like narrative experience along with simply a beautiful world to explore.

Although I confess to being a bit of a button-masher, the first-person shooters I've played the most are the ones that offered rich environments to explore, even while trying not to get killed. [*Bioshock*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock)'s underwater city of Rapture stands out for its beautiful and dystopian [art nouveau environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xogTYEZEZqU). I think that early point-and-click adventure games are responsible to some degree for my need to explore, but open world games have me idling through spaces just for the wonder of it all. I really have enjoyed the new generation of [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider) games for satisfying the combination of exploration and puzzle-solving, and [beautiful and eerie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEjSUp5iRe4) environments. The game in which I have clocked the most hours is [*Guild Wars 2*](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/). I'm a horrible player, but mostly what I do is roam around the [environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQvATvBVTo), just taking in the amazing artwork, the character creation, the scenery, the [animation of the battle actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zvfijc3SN4), the environmental effects. There have been major updates to the game that have completely reshaped the landscape and familiar landmarks in surprising ways, so there is always more to see and explore.

Recently, I've had even less time to game, however. But, I've started to gravitate toward a genre of games that I avoided in the past a being too slow, much like my early experiences with Japanese film and literature years ago. Now, I'm finding myself enjoying JRPGs precisely because of the slow pace. I'm close to 40 hours into [*Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI) and look forward to each opportunity to get a little more time with the [world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq4NH1TSSxE) and the characters. I think it also appeals to the top-tier level of dad-humor associated with the [monster names and designs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoeuLbr2OFk). But, like Guild Wars 2, it is a fun world to explore and to simply linger in as I travel through it.

Maybe it's my age, and maybe it is just the pandemic forcing us to be stuck at home for so long, that this "longing to linger" is just so resonant for me right now. 

Interestingly enough, though, deciding to write about a "longing to linger" came from a completely different source, but I'll write about that in a part 2 to come.
