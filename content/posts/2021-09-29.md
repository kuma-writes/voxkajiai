I recently joined a new (to me) Facebook group for fans of children's television programming in the 1970s. I can't recall the exact trigger that led me to revisit that garden path again, but it likely may have been related to a recent birthday. It still does not seem possible that 1975 is further in my past today than World War II was when I was a child in 1975!

For me, while the Looney Toons and the works of Jim Henson probably are of greater significance, four other names came to define almost exclusively my memories of children's television growing up in the 1970s. [William Hanna and Joseph Barbera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna-Barbera) provided nearly all of the animation (outside of Warner Bros. studios), and [Sid & Marty Krofft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_and_Marty_Krofft) brought forth a Technicolor kaleidoscope of imaginative live action shows. I know that all of them were simple and formulaic, but they were the bright moments of joy on my Saturday mornings. Every September I eagerly awaited the Saturday morning fall TV lineup preview show that aired on Friday night before the new shows began. 

Many of the Hanna-Barbera shows I watched had first aired in the late 50s and throughout the 60s, and were already running in syndication when they entered my life: [The Flintstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones), [Huckleberry Hound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huckleberry_Hound_Show), [Top Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Cat), [The Jetsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jetsons), [Yogi Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yogi_Bear_Show), [Magilla Gorilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magilla_Gorilla_Show), [Quick Draw McGraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_Draw_McGraw_Show), [The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atom_Ant/Secret_Squirrel_Show), [Space Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Ghost_(TV_series)), [The Wacky Races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Races_(1968_TV_series)), [Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo,_Where_Are_You!), and a particular favorite, [Jonny Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Quest_(TV_series)). The bridge to the 1970s was probably [The Banana Splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banana_Splits), which blended live-action set pieces and introduced short animated episodes interspersed within the hour. I still think that [The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn), which started out as its own show and was eventually rolled into syndication as part of The Banana Splits, was ground-breaking as a children's show for its combination of live actors in animated scenes.

During the 1970s, Hanna-Barbera released 68 new shows, a staggering number. Although most only lasted for one season, many of them ran in syndication for years afterward. The standouts for me, probably as much for the way they clawed their way deeply into my memory cells through repeat showings as anything, include: [Josie and the Pussycats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_(TV_series)), [The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Chan_and_the_Chan_Clan), [Sealab 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealab_2020), [Speed Buggy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Buggy), [Super Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Friends_(1973_TV_series)), [Hong Kong Phooey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Phooey), [Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelie_and_the_Chopper_Bunch), [The Great Grape Ape Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Grape_Ape_Show), [Jabberjaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberjaw), and [The New Shmoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Shmoo). There were also numerous iterations of many of these shows and characters, though I think [Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_(TV_series)#Josie_and_the_Pussycats_in_Outer_Space) is the one I remember most fondly. Looking back, I think it must have influenced my interest in women rock musicians and even some Japanese animé, given the overwhelming "cuteness" of [Melody and the alien Bleep](https://hanna-barbera.fandom.com/wiki/Bleep?file=Melody_and_Bleep.png). The animé aesthetic is certainly there. Of course, there are many, many more characters in the Hanna-Barbera universe and encoded in my memory cells. 

In 1979, I moved from the northeast to the southwest. The move also marked my transition from elementary school to junior high and the natural, gradual progression away from Saturday morning cartoons, as school work increased and there were other activities to draw my attention. Among them were computers, early video games like the Atari VCS, and Dungeons & Dragons.

During the 1980s, kids started to see the rise of cartoons as 30-minute commercials, with the emergence of [He-Man and the Masters of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He-Man), [G.I. Joe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe:_A_Real_American_Hero_(1983_TV_series)), [Care Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_Bears_(TV_series)) and [My Little Pony and Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony_%27n_Friends). Sure, the 70s shows had product tie-ins, but as that amped up in the 80s, the quality of the programming went down, many would argue.[^1] Certainly much of the idealism of the 70s that was imbued in many of the programs gave way to even more soullessness and crass consumerism of later fare, with some exceptions. 

None of my childhood TV was high art, but the shows of the 70s seemed more connected to vaudevillian roots and in many ways seemed to be more closely aligned with the television programming for adults, but for a different, younger audience. And, in fact, the targeted age demographic dropped from the 70s to the 80s. Some of this can be attributed to the increase of television sets in U.S. households, since more sets in the home meant that adults and children could watch programming separately.[^2] But, there were other industry factors at work as well. As some parents complained about violence and scenes of peril, the content became more sanitized. In the process, too, the complexity of the language decreased and stories became less sophisticated. Even the animation became more simplistic, with fewer individual cels per second of screen time. It would take nearly a decade for things to shift back, thanks to cable television channels like Nickelodeon switching on. 

Several years ago, I really enjoyed the chance to revisit some of the Hanna-Barbera character during my visit to the [Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)](https://omsi.edu) as part of their Animation exhibit. The exhibit itself is gone now and has been [repackaged](https://omsi.edu/products/animationland) as a more generic animation exhibit that can be rented by other museums, so I'm thankful for the opportunity.

In part 2, I'll look back fondly at the world of Sid & Marty Krofft.

[^1]: I understand that we all have a particular fondness for the shows that shaped our individual childhood years, and nostalgia for 80s is on the rise with recent remakes of He-Man, She-Ra, and others. But, it is a documented fact that many of the cartoons in the 80s were designed from the beginning to sell toys, ever since the success of Star Wars and the accompanying toys from Kenner.
