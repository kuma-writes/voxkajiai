For the past week or so I've been logging into my computer only to find a message onscreen that the system has run out of memory. This is a recent phenomenon and I'm still in the dark about what is causing it, which is a bit frustrating, but it did kick off a bit of a journey for me today.

I started with a web search, because that's what we modern humans do, specifically to see if others had reported the issue recently. Unfortunately, most of what I found was not particularly timely nor relevant, with a number of "articles" simply being software push pieces--"How to solve your memory problems? Buy our software." I've been using a Macintosh for decades at this point. I have not had to deal with memory issues since the pre-OSX days. There's a reason the [RamDoubler](https://dfarq.homeip.net/ram-doubler-remembered/) product was a best-seller and an essential piece of software back in the Mac OS 7-9 days. At least the recent memory issues have rarely locked up the entire system[^1], as was pretty common two decades ago. Nonetheless, I did open up the Activity Monitor app to see what was going on.

One thing that I have noticed over the past several years is the surprising number of Apple system agents running in the background, some with notable names that send to my web search site to learn more about. These include: [bird](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6606275), [familycircled](https://answerstoall.com/technology/how-do-i-update-certificates-on-my-mac/#What_is_Familycircled_on_Mac), [deleted](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254810/what-is-the-deleted-daemon-in-macos), [fileproviderd](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/84o8h3/question_what_is_fileproviderd_i_saw_it_in/), [imagent](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86814/firewall-settings-with-imagent), [parsecd](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/266989/what-is-parsecd), [pbs](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pbs-process.159503/), [rapportd](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/308294/what-is-rapportd-and-why-does-it-want-incoming-network-connections), [reversetemplated](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250082967), [spindump_agent](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/spindump.8.html), and [VTDecoderXPCService](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/5lzg58/what_is_vtdecoderxpcservice_when_i_kill_the/). I can certainly guess what some of those might be for, but I really have no concrete idea without looking them up. Others, like [adprivacyd](https://www.unix.com/man-page/mojave/8/adprivacyd), [DiskUnmountWatcher](https://www.unix.com/man-page/mojave/8/diskunmountwatcher), and [SocialPushAgent](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/socialpushagent-what-is-this.1521485/) I can make a pretty informed guess about. But, I digress.

Beyond the system services, there were certainly a few application agents for software I am no longer using, so I decided to prune a few of those. I started with the pieces that had identifiable uninstallers, thank you [Razer](https://www.razer.com) and [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/). I then downloaded the free [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) and continued with a few more. I uninstalled [Amazon Luna](https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page), since I really have way too many games already to justify paying for a new service[^2]. I uninstalled the VPN software used by my former employers. I uninstalled a few Chrome apps. Then, I restarted.

I highly doubt that the software removals will influence overall performance, but it is always nice to purge periodically. I had already run [Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html)[^3] about a week ago, so I was already feeling the system was a bit cleaner. I did, however, take a moment to pop open the *About this Mac* screen to review the specs. 8GB of main memory has served me well since buying this 27" late-2012 iMac refurbished back in 2013. It occurred to me, though, that this is one of the last of several models released before Apple began soldering memory to the main board. Could I upgrade the memory? And, if I can, might this be one of the last of my investments into this machine to get a couple more years from it? Turns out that I can, so I researched that a bit, comparison shopped, and placed an order with [Newegg](https://newegg.com) for an additional 16GB of [Crucial](https://www.crucial.com) memory, and carried on with the purging.

Next on the list was a chore that I have been avoiding for probably 5-7 years. It was time to tackle the web bookmarks! But, like going through old photo boxes, that was a trip down memory lane, and a topic worthy of its own entry tomorrow.

[^1]: Sure, sometimes I do get encounter a complete lockup, but it was a much more frequent occurrence back before OS X with its spinning beachball. The [Sad Mac](https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Sad_Mac) and [Mac Bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_(icon)) icons are now, well, iconic pieces of Maclore, and we have the talents of [Susan Kare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare) to thank for those wonderful [images](https://www.cnet.com/pictures/susan-kares-early-mac-icons-gave-computers-a-personality-photos/3/).

[^2]: I simply have to smile at the fact that the Amazon Luna software includes a client called "SpiderPork"!

[^3]: FWIW, Onyx is a fantastic utility and one of the first apps I install after upgrading to a new MacOS.
