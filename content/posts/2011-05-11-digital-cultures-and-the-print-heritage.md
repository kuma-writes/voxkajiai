I have just begun reading _Digital Cultures_ by Milad Doueihi, which was original published in French. What struck me right from the start was this passage in the opening “Note to the American Edition”:

> ...we need to rethink some of our received models, so embedded within print and its powerful heritage (both cultural and legal), in order to better appreciate the new dimensions of digital culture. In the same manner that digital tools disturb our received ideas about authorship and reading, digital literacy invites a new look and an evaluation of what it means to be literate. In the digital environment, more so than at any other moment in the past, literacy is the agency not only of communication and the production and exchange of knowledge; it is also the site of the deployment of a new iteration of individual and collective identities. In this fashion, it is also the site of a conflict, one opposing our inherited practices and their powerful history and the emerging new world of digital culture. (p. x)

And then in the preface, a somewhat similar statement:

> ...one can say that the digital environment is at the moment experiencing a crisis derived from its early reliance and desire to carry over and extend elements of print culture (such as embedded and legal forms of authorship, copyright, but also crucial concepts such as page, book and the notions of property associated with them) into its own, and from its current desire, in part due to the development of new technologies and their associated emerging practices, to liberate itself from the weight of such a burden. (p. xiv)

I’m looking forward to reading this book and seeing how Doueihi develops these ideas more fully, but I must say that I am particularly intrigued by these statements. These are issues that I struggle with on a regular basis working in a technical field within a higher education setting, and even more so now that I am part of a library culture that is also wrestling with these issues. For the library, I believe these are of interest because it is going to be nigh impossible to escape from the print heritage as long as publishers continue to root all business transactions and legal authority in that legacy world. And, let’s not kid ourselves, libraries have untold millions invested in the print culture that sits on their shelves.

The libraries, however, are adapting to digital changes and the librarians with whom I work are more than willing to engage in these sites of conflict. I believe many of the bibliographers and teaching librarians view themselves as stewards not of “print culture” but of “information.” They are as invested as I am in helping students and faculty figure out ways of navigating and making sense of our digital culture, and in pushing faculty to think critically about how it differs from our print heritage. Those conversations alone can be challenging ones, as many of our faculty are not convinced that it IS different, that bits on a screen are no different than ink on a page.

Nevertheless, we press on, not with answers but with the candlelight of our convictions to help guide us into the foggy future. I hope that in reading Doueihi’s book I may be able to increase the brightness of that candle even a tiny bit.

Librarians, assuming you have not already read this book, I would love to hear your thoughts on the above two statements and I would like to invite you to read the book as well, perhaps for a follow-up conversation and posting.
