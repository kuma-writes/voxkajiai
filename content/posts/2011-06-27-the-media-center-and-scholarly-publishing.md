Our library has just recently updated and posted its Mission and Goals for FY 2012, along with a new vision statement that I like for its succinctness and word play:

> “Inspiring ideas for personal transformation and global impact.”

Now, of course, it becomes my challenge to align my department’s goals with the vision, mission, and goals of the library. Some of the goals are easier to aim at than others. I’ve already begun to think about ways in which we can help to market our resources and services to the campus community, for example. It is the loftier goals that challenge me to think more deeply. One of them is as follows:

> Build collaborations to support faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student scholarly publishing

I find it interesting, though not surprising for a library, that one of our goals centers on scholarly publishing. What I like about this is that I have keen interest in defining, redefining or broadening the definition of “scholarly publishing.” It’s not just about dead trees and ink anymore.

In years past, a media center would not necessarily be actively involved in the scholar publishing of faculty and students. But on our campus this has been changing over the past several years. We are seeing more and more courses across the curriculum offer students the choice of making a video or other multimedia project in lieu of a paper, and the quality of the work and the level of academic inquiry on these projects has increased as well.

Many of these student scholars today are likely to become faculty scholars of tomorrow, and I’m confident that at least some of these students will publish and/or present their scholarship in ways that are not confined to text.

Nevertheless, there are efforts in the library, too, to play a larger role in digital publishing of journals and manuscripts. We are also actively encouraging greater awareness of the creative commons, both for sources and for determining the publishing rights of campus authors.

Thankfully, these are all areas where our media center can, in fact, contribute. As the hub for digital media resources on campus, we have been collaborating with faculty for years. I’m only too happy to build and strengthen the relationships and add what we can to ongoing scholarly publishing on our campus.

What’s happening on your campus? Is your media center branching out to be more than a hardware/software loan service? If not, what’s holding you back? What are the challenges that you face?
