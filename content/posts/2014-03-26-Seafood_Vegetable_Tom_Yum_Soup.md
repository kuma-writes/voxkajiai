*Comment:* This is an easy, fairly quick satisfying soup for a warm day.

*Yield:* 4-6 servings

__INGREDIENTS__

* 5 cups chicken soup stock
* 1 inch of ginger sliced thin
* zest of one lemon
* 1 1/2 tablespoon (Korean) chile paste
* 5 tablespoons lime juice
* 3 tablespoons fish sauce

* 3 leaves of napa cabbage sliced thin
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1 carrot peeled and sliced thin

* 1 handful of cilantro coarsely chopped
* 1 green onion sliced thin, for garnish (optional)

__PREPARATION__

1. In a pot, combine chicken stock, ginger, lemon zest and chile paste and bring to a boil. If you prefer, put zest into a tea pack or herb cooking sachet.
2. Add fish sauce, lime juice, shallots, tomato, cabbage, mushrooms, and carrot and simmer for 5-10 minutes, depending on how firm you like your vegetables.
3. Add shrimp and fish and continue cooking for 3-5 more minutes until fish is cooked.
4. Turn off heat and add cilantro.
5. Serve and garnish with additional cilantro (and/or green onion)
6. Optional: Add cooked rice before serving for a heartier stew
