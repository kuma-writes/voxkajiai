\[This is the second part of the series I [began last Friday](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-1/ "Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots! (Part 1)"), describing how your academic librarians are fighting the fight to continue to provide you and all patrons with access to materials in new and old formats, and the challenges they face in regards to copyright law.\]

As content becomes available in new forms, and as these new forms become the basis of scholarly study, the library is there and want to provide access to these materials. Today’s libraries collect books, journals, graphic novels, microfilm, films, videos, albums, cassette tapes, reel-to-reel tapes, CDs, DVDs. With video games becoming more and more the subject of academic inquiry, more libraries have begun acquiring games. Regardless of format, having ready access to materials in the collection encourages their use.

I remember the days of renting a film to show on campus. Prices for a single showing to a class could easily be hundreds of dollars and additional showings only increased the cost. With VHS and DVDs added to the collection, the ease-of-use and ready availability means that courses across the entire campus curriculum now make regular use of films, television shows, cultural programs, and documentaries. But digital-only assets threaten to move us back the other direction, back to limited availability and pay-per-loan/pay-per-show arrangements.

Where are the Netflix options for campus libraries? Kindle and Audible enterprise agreements? There was a big brouhaha last year when a library admitted to purchasing a few Netflix accounts to make streaming media available to their students. Current copyright and DMCA laws stifle the ability of libraries to make their physical collection available via streaming on campus, so alternatives are needed. Even were there a campus Netflix license, I’ve written [before](http://wp.me/p1wqQR-s) about the risk of asset access being suddenly revoked, due to either contract expirations or contract conflict between Netflix and the Hollywood distributors.

We are starting to see some modern digital asset agreements come to the library, but for the most part these licenses still treat the asset as a sparse resource. Audio books are available to a single patron and essentially self-destruct on the patron’s device at the end of the loan period. On the one hand, some digital collections can run tens of thousands of dollars annually regardless of how often the materials are used, and other collection items will self-destruct after as few as five digital “checkouts,” forcing the library to re-buy access to the item for another five loans. I would not object so much to this latter model except that the five-loan price is on par with that of a physical item that can be loaned out significantly more often.

There is currently no streaming video service for institutions with the breadth of something like Netflix. If given the option, I’m sure the MPAA would prefer to see libraries pay full retail for every loan of a Hollywood title. I’m certain that libraries are doing what they can to provide access to commercial materials through digital distribution agreements. But that effort needs to be escalated.

Either the ALA needs a stronger lobby in D.C., or public, private and academic libraries across the U.S. need to band together more tightly to negotiate _en masse_ for reasonably priced usage rights. If anyone has the historical foundation, resources, and imperative to do this, it is our libraries and librarians.
