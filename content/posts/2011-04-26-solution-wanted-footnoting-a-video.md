The footnote (or endnote) is a great device in scholarly writing. Not only does it help to clarify the source of external passages or ideas, but it does so very unobtrusively via a superscripted number or character. Of course, more and more today we see references embedded directly within text, but they are minimal enough to simply breeze right by them without interrupting the flow of the passage. This is brilliant! We really need something like this for video. Some will say that is what the end credit are for, but I'm talking about something different.

I recently had the opportunity to watch a video created by students for a writing course. The video was a mix of original recorded video and voiceover along with numerous clips off of YouTube. Afterwards, there was a perception by some in the audience that the video represented a collection of student-collated materials. It was, just not to the level that it appeared. A quick search immediately turned up the clips from YouTube that the student had appropriated.

It wasn't that the students used YouTube video, it was more that the students took videos that were already cut together by someone else into a narrative, and then used that narrative in their own work. Watching the video, you were never certain where the students' ideas ended and the YouTube poster's ideas began. There was no clear "footnote" within the video. Even if the clips were cited in the credits, the problem still exists.

End credits are more similar to a bibliography rather than to footnotes or endnotes. The bibliography simply lists all reference sources, while footnotes give more detailed information about materials obtained from others. Where is the video from? How much time did you use? What time excerpt did you use?

With more and more students being asked to create video and multimedia projects as part of their academic research, we really need to devise a standard of citation to use within these projects. We need something that is not merely a "slapping on" of traditional text-based citation mechanisms. Something with the elegance and detail of the footnote, but designed for video.

What I'm imagining is a standard for a metadata layer that can be toggled on or off much like subtitles. This is better than a persistent on-screen citation because it stays out of the way during viewing, but can be validated when the work comes under more academic scrutiny. Although this could appear in the lower-third of the screen, I feel it needs to be off the screen entirely, in a sidebar or a drawer-like area that can be opened or closed. On-screen, not only does it interfere with the video, but it also runs the risk of being overwritten by ads in the current free-to-post model of online video hosting services.

What do you think? Does this already exist? Give me some feedback or point me in the right direction.
