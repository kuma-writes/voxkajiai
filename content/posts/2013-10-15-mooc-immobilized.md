This fall I am once again enrolled in a MOOC course (redundant?). This is my third attempt to finish a course, and with each one I make a little more progress. This time, in particular, I put a little skin in the game--I signed up and paid for the certified level of the course. [![320px-Denver_boot](http://mediamixed.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/320px-denver_boot.jpg?w=300)](http://mediamixed.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/320px-denver_boot.jpg)

If you are not familiar with Coursera’s Signature Track it involves a system for trying to verify the work that you submit is actually yours. Every time I attempt a homework quiz, this system asks me to check a box stating that the work is mine. It then lights up my computer’s built-in camera to take a picture in order to confirm me visually. Finally, I am asked to type a statement certifying the work is my own, and my keystrokes are used to “fingerprint” my typing style.

Overall, it’s not a bad system, though I recognize how it possibly could be exploited. More importantly, though, is how things can go a bit wrong for a valid and earnest “student,” such as myself.

Up until two weeks ago, the course has been going well. That’s when my travels began-a week of vacation and then a conference. The night before leaving (a Friday night), I scrambled to finish the work that was due by the following Tuesday. Then, when I next had network connectivity, I downloaded all the videos for the next lesson, not knowing when I might have another connection. \[Note: This was a great relief, and a great help for students who may not have persistent Internet access.\] My intentions were good, but traveling being what it is, I was not able to finish watching all the videos on my regular timeline.

One trip finished, but another was about the begin, and now I was a week behind. I was relieved to discover, however, that the Tuesday deadline for homework submission had now been extended to Saturday. I proceeded to download the new videos and committed to catching up during my second trip. Coincidentally, I also decided to travel lighter, taking only my iPad and Bluetooth keyboard, instead of a full laptop.

Each night I watched videos, made notes, read related materials and completed ungraded mini quizzes. By Thursday night, I was ready to complete the graded homework and then it hit me. Could I complete the Signature Track requirements with the iPad? It has a camera and a keyboard, but…it doesn’t do (Adobe) Flash! Sure enough, there was the tech note on the Coursera site confirming that the Signature Track is not currently supported on mobile devices.

I was prepared to borrow a laptop from another conference attendee but thankfully the hotel provided the solution I needed. The “business center” not only had computers, more importantly it had contemporary desktops with built-in webcams! Yay! I completed my assignment and successfully submitted my work.

Lesson learned. Read the fine print. MOOCs may not yet be fully “mobilized” even if most of content is readily accessible. Now back to catching up, on my laptop.
