I was very saddened today to read of the discovery of James Kim's body in the Oregon wilderness. More than other tragic events in recent memory, I can't say why, but his passing is having a deep emotional affect on me.

Except as a CNET watcher on TIVO and as a fan of the former TechTV network I had no relationship with James. I was merely one of his audience members.

I first learned that he and his family were missing last week via a story on Digg. I then followed the story daily, fearing the worst. I was greatly relieved when his family was found, and then was immediately disheartened to learn that James had finally struck out on his own for help. Like so many other people, I continued checking on the story via CNET hoping for the best, but somewhere deep down knowing that the odds were against him.

As the story of the first nine days came out, James and his family earned even more of my respect. James and Kati truly did everything they could to help the family survive. As a father myself, I don't know if I could have lasted as long before heading out.

The past several days, all I could think about were James' solitary thoughts as he headed out into the elements. He had no way of knowing that his family would be found before him. And so I play out the words that would surely be on my mind, "I must persevere for them. I must try. Please grant me the strength." And, ultimately in despair, "I am so sorry. Know that I love you."

That is the profound sadness that I feel.

His friends and family have my deepest sympathies. I'm sure that he will be missed.

CNET now has a memorial page. (edited to point to [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Kim))
