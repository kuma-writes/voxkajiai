How many of you have jumped on the badging bandwagon? If you have, I’m curious which wagon you’re on? I’ve probably been optimistic about badging for 2-3 years now, ever since hearing about badging at an ELI Conference.

So far, though, we’ve only had one real wagon pull out this station, but it was a good one and it was connected to a campus course. Instructional Designer Mike Goudzwaard worked with Professor Michael Evans on an interdisciplinary course on “Science and Religion in America.” They developed several badges to track students’ progress through a set of digital scholarship skills. The decision to use badges, in addition to grades, was guided by a desire to communicate student competency beyond the grades alone.

Here in the Jones Media Center, my staff worked with the Prof. Evans to develop a badge sequence for learning to use the Mediathread platform created by Columbia University. The badging outcomes ranged from “attend a training” to “create a Mediathread project based on training.” You can read more about the course and badging in Joshua Kim’s interview with Michael and Mike for the Inside Higher Ed blog.

While that is certainly the first badge program we’ve worked on, I hope it’s not the last. I’ve wanted us to develop badging for other courses, too, but the challenge, I believe, is that it needs to permeate the course to be meaningful, in the way the Prof. Evans used badging throughout his course. We are always trying to develop the skills of students as they complete multimedia/multimodal assignments. This involves, in particular, camera skills, audio recording skills, editing skills and storytelling skills. I’m hoping that we can put together a package of multimedia badges that we can offer to faculty who are ready to employ badging in their courses. While I’m not 100% sold on badges, I do think it is important to have a way to recognize the skills students learn in a given course, and badging provides more information than does a letter grade on a transcript.

But, I’m also trying to implement badging as part of our student training process, too. Whether student work for us essentially as circulation assistants or as technical assistants, defining a series of proficiencies that they can, ultimately, leave with, should not only make it easier for them to describe what they have done while working for us, but also make it easy for us to more reliably describe their accomplishments when we get contacted as a reference. I think badging also offers possibilities for opening up higher-end professional grade media equipment to our students—complete a badging sequence, receive badge, show us the badge on your LinkedIn page and now the (gimbal, jib, drone, dolly, DSLR) is available to you to borrow.

What about you? Is your media center badging as part of your instructional design work or for your student employee program? What challenges are you facing? I’d welcome your thoughts.
