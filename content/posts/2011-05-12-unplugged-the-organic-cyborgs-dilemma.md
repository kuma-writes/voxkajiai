At 9:26 p.m. last night, from just off to the right of and behind my browser window, my eye detected the slightest upward movement of my iChat avatar icon. A response must have come in from my wife, even though my Dock icon did not simultaneously bounce. I Command-Tabbed over to iChat to see my lonely avatar standing above the message, “You left the chat or were disconnected.” I’ve been seeing this problem recently so I wasn’t surprised. I quickly fired up Skype and found no one online there either. Curious. Next, my browser began struggling to load the page...any page. Alright, must be the wireless router. The web page to that also was only intermittently responsive. Reset the router and confirmed that there was now no WAN address. My cord was unceremoniously pulled and I found myself disconnected. COMCAST!!!!

Ok, it was time to try the other approaches. Pulled plugs on the cable modem and the router and let them sit while I went to do dishes. After 10-15 minutes, I powered up everything again but still found no WAN connection. No, instead my cable modem and router decided to attend a private disco party, dancing to their own music while tapping out unknown rhythms with all their LEDs. By this time nearly an hour has passed. I was getting close to calling it a night, but decided to call Comcast to see if there was larger system outage.

Except, of course, I have the Comcast Triple-Play package and just then discovered that I’ve got a runner on base (my cable television signal), two outs (Internet AND phone), and no more players left to call up to bat! Not only that but my pay-as-you-go cellphone, my pitch hitter, was down to 4 minutes of credit, which would barely get me through the voice-activated menu. At that point, I’m essentially dead in the water and out of options other than to simply head to sleep, which I did.

However, during this small adventure, it occurred to me, once again, that I am far more reliant on my connectivity than I realize. Even without being half-machine, like a cyborg, I’m am just as dependent on my power and connection to the digital world. I’m not blind to my purely analog options, and could easily have entertained myself with a book, or could have gone to the kitchen to make a pot of tea, or done any number of things that did not rely on an Internet connection. In daytime hours, I would be more than willing to work outside, take a stroll, or tinker in the garage. Even last night, I could have even just plopped myself back down on the sofa to watch television, but that was the passive alternative.

What was unique last night was that I happened to have been in an information gathering mode and felt that connections were vital. I was in the middle of a several conversation threads on Facebook. I was similarly engaged in some e-mail back-and-forths. I was just about to chat with my wife, who currently happens to be 3000+ miles away. And when I realized the problem rose to the level of “engage with customer support,” even that avenue was closed to me. When I felt I needed my access most, its loss was more acutely felt.

Perhaps it is an oxymoron or a misnomer to claim to be an “organic cyborg,” but even with no inorganic body parts, technology plays such a strong role in my life that I feel less complete, less active, and less engaged, when I am unplugged.

\[Note: normal connectivity appears to have been restored at 6:43 a.m. this morning.\]
