Earlier this month, Susan Cain wrote in The New York Times about the latest threat to our schools and our workplaces in her opinion piece, “[The Rise of the New Groupthink](nyti.ms/zIp8l9).” While I don’t dismiss her article entirely, I do feel that she is attempting paint broad strokes on a canvas with a very narrow brush. In particular, she appears to be repudiating team-based approaches to work and education for everyone on the grounds that it doesn’t work well for introverts. In fact she spends nearly 20 paragraphs writing against the benefits of teams before offering “a more nuanced approach to creativity and learning.”

I will agree with Cain that many fine ideas come from individuals working alone, but so do outlandish, hare-brained ideas that can never fly. Steve Wozniak is a brilliant man whom I respect greatly, but there is every possibility that, without the charisma of Steve Jobs and, ultimately, the efforts of everyone who brought Apple computers to the marketplace (yes, I know the longer version of the story, with Steve and Steve building their earliest shipments in the garage), Wozniak’s work would have remained exclusively in the hands of homebrew enthusiasts the world over. After all, not everyone is a genius, (and not everyone has the charisma of Steve Jobs), but not all the ideas from the smartest minds are good ones. In fact, many bright, successful people will tell you of their failures along the way.

More importantly, though, great ideas are also born of “happy collisions” and can be nourished to reality among groups. A librarian friend of mine has just penned an article on “[Collision Spaces](http://acrlog.org/2012/01/24/collision-spaces/)” and the benefits of serendipitous meetings and chance encounters, lost when architectural design favors more private offices and fewer group spaces. While I count myself lucky to have a private space in which to work, I do spend a lot of time in meetings, both formal and informal (do not underestimate the benefits of an impromptu hallway gathering!). The “group” represented by the attendees of those meetings, however, knows far more together than I know as an individual. Most people would not call me an introvert, though, so I am not afraid to voice my opinions and ideas in those meetings, and welcome the feedback from others to tell me why I’m wrong, why I may be insufficiently informed, or why my thoughts are valued. The groups that I have the pleasure of working with, for the most part, help me to improve and give shape to my ideas so that they have a better chance of succeeding when they are realized.

I do not disagree that more and more time during the workday is spent in meetings, and not all of it is productive. Nor do I disagree that many of us need time away, in the nooks and crannies or in our own offices, to be more productive. I think that’s true for introverts and extroverts alike.

For me, though, Cain’s attempt to brand “Groupthink” as some new form of socialistic threat to our communities is just misguided. It is not about conformity in classroom pods, it is about the exchange of ideas in those pods, the sharing of knowledge, the strong helping the weak, and about learning how to work with others. For better or worse, these are skills that the modern worker, and the modern society, needs. While it is not a given, we CAN be brighter together.
