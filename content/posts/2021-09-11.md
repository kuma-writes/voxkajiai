There are songs that were not written to be part of soundtracks, and there are those that take on a completely different life by being part of soundtracks. Like the wine chosen by a sommelier to perfectly enhance your dining experience, these songs rise above their original release to become the perfect pairing for a film scene or story. 

Watching the new trailer for [*The Matrix Resurrections*](https://youtu.be/9ix7TUGVYIo), Jefferson Airplane's 1967 song ["White Rabbit"](https://youtu.be/WANNqr-vcx0) by Grace Slick is the perfect accompaniment to the trailer. While it is not the first film to feature the song, it lands just right, giving the trailer both the tension and otherworldliness it needs. On a side note, the Wikipedia entry for ["White Rabbit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit_(song)) is worth a read not only for the backstory on the song but also to learn about the influences from Miles Davis and Ravel.

Certainly there are other examples of perfect music/film pairings. For film buffs or those of a certain age, an iconic one is Wagner's [Ride of the Valkyries"](https://youtu.be/hn37QfXw1-E) played as helicopters descend into battle in Francis Ford Coppola's [*Apocalypse Now*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/). And in a similar vein, another that comes to mind for me is Carl Orff's "O Fortuna" from Carmina Burana played as the land revives following Perceval's delivery of the Holy Grail to King Arthur, who is himself revived by its restorative waters, in John Boorman's 1981 film [*Excalibur*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur_(film)). Though not from the actual scene in the film, [this live performance](https://youtu.be/4vu-t5-YL6Q) from the Nederlands Concertkoor while scenes from the film play is very moving, as is this [HD Film Tribute](https://youtu.be/0JNlOTccdck) version.

There's a whole different category of pairings, too, where the song is in direct opposition to the action, but I'll leave that for a future entry perhaps, except to say, *A Clockwork Orange*, and leave it to others to explore that rabbit hole.
