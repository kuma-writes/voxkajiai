Reading books on an portable electronic device is nothing new to me. I’ve been doing it for probably 15 years or so, going back to Peanut Press titles on my Palm Pilot. My experience with interactive fiction goes back even further. And yet, I still have never been fully sold on eBooks, eMagazines and the like. But, I may finally be coming around to it, but only by changing my way of thinking, and watching as, hopefully, the publishing industry starts to change as well. ![](images/200px-EPUB_logo.svg.png "Epub Logo")

The problem for me has been, I believe, that ePublishing has primarily focused on “how do we make books digital?” rather than “how do we publish effectively in the digital age?”

I’m still a huge fan of “dead tree” editions of both books and magazines. While I have cut back on both my subscriptions and the number of books that I buy, I have not moved those dollars to digital editions. For the most part, I’m not interested in simply having an “e-text” edition. While the digital version offers some convenience for portability and for storage, I’m giving up too much of what I enjoy about the physical thing.

However, more and more I find myself reading the paper magazines that I subscribe to and wishing for them to be more interactive. I confess, I’m not talking about [_The New Yorker_](http://newyorker.com) or [_The Economist_](http://www.economist.com), though I’m sure they could benefit from some interactivity as well. My subscriptions include _[PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com), [Wired](http://www.wired.com),_ and [_Popular Science_](http://www.popsci.com). These publications now regularly include interactive elements, usually in the form of web links, but this requires me to fire up my laptop/iPad/or desktop and then my browser, magazine in hand. A digital version would take me right to the link or, better yet, embed the content right on the digital page. A few months after I read them, many of the news and opinion pieces of these magazines lose their value to me. I would throw out my back issues but for another feature that keeps them on my shelf--the DIY stories, the machinima video links, the coverage of game mods and free indie games. These aspects outlive the usefulness of much of the rest of the magazine. And frankly, it is just too much work to cull through the list of links and make my own reference guide, or even to rip out the pages that I want and scan them into my PDF library.

So, really, what I’m after is the best of both worlds. I want the paper edition that can live in my bathroom “reading basket,” as well as the enriched digital edition. But I’m selfish, and cheap. Don’t make me pay twice for the same subscription. Give me a blended price, not unlike the old model of a paper subscription with the disc stuck to the cover.
