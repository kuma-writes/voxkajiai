On this episode, questions without answers. Do books define who we are? Josh considers getting rid of all of his books. Anthony goes "over the wall" of a Buddhist monastery. What does e-publishing mean for the future of Scholastic Books in elementary school?

Also, Josh continues to explore "collaboration space" in the Library. To what degree is our campus unique with the Library functioning as a study AND social center of campus?

In reading, Laura is working through a backlog of The New Yorker, Anthony finally finishes _[A Dance with Dragons](http://www.amazon.com/Dance-Dragons-Book-Song-Fire/dp/0006486118/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333131288&sr=1-1)_, book 5 of the Game of Thrones series, and Josh is looking for suggestions. Maybe Matthew Pearl's _[The Technologists](http://www.amazon.com/The-Technologists-Novel-Matthew-Pearl/dp/1400066573/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333131309&sr=1-1)_ will fit the bill. Anthony also turns back towards contemporary Japanese literature, beginning with Natsuo Kirino's _[Out: A Novel](http://www.amazon.com/Out-A-Novel-Natsuo-Kirino/dp/1400078377/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333131334&sr=1-1)_, but also goes non-fiction in checking out _[Shiny Objects: Why We Spend Money We Don't Have in Search of Happiness We Can't Buy](http://www.amazon.com/Shiny-Objects-Spend-Search-Happiness/dp/0062093606/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333131363&sr=1-1)_ by James A. Roberts.

On screen, Josh finishes season one of _[Justified](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489428/)_ and is finally hooked into _[Downton Abbey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/)_. Laura wraps up her first watching of _[Firefly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/)_ and prepares to embark on _[Breaking Bad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/)_, if she can find the time as new seasons begin for returning shows. Anthony checks out the original BBC series _[The Singing Detective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090521/)_. _[Prime Suspect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582456/)_ may be cancelled, but Josh is really enjoying the recent episodes of _[The Office](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/)_.

And someone really needs to get to work on a new game: Six Degrees of Harry Potter!
