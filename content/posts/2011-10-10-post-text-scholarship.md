I really just want to share this posting by Brian Matthews over at the Chronicle's "The Ubiquitous Librarian" blog. The entry is titled, "[The New English Major; some thoughts about post-text scholarship"](http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/theubiquitouslibrarian/2011/10/07/the-new-english-major-some-thoughts-about-post-text-scholarship/) and is worth a read. He and I, and many others, are in similar territory here.

An excerpt:

> Imagine that the majority of students coming to your desk/office/studio are not writing a term paper but developing a video-based argumentâ€”using sound, data, images, and so forth. If this is how they are being evaluated, how do we help them? And likewise, if this is a major output for faculty and researchers, how do we enable them?

A nod to my librarian friend LRB for passing this along.
