I’m dating myself, I’m sure, to recall the old Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup commercial where the guy with the peanut butter runs into the guy with the chocolate bar and the happy accident brings home the tag line, “Two great tastes that go great together.” Anyway, that’s how I felt this weekend when I came upon the perfect blending of a song mashup and a visualization, two of my favorite uses of technology.

As you’ll see if you visit “[Anatomy of a Mashup](http://daftpunk.themaninblue.com/),” Cameron Adams created a mashup from the work of the electronic musicians [Daft Punk](http://daftpunk.com/ "Daft Punk's Web Site"), 23 songs to be precise. He then went one step further to create the live visualization of the mashup, so you can hear his creation, watching as each new pieces is introduced during playback, and you can follow the timeline to see exactly how each piece of music was layered into the final product. Overall, a very impressive work.

I didn’t recognize the name at first, but clicking through the music video took me to Adams’ website, [The Man in Blue](http://themaninblue.com/), where I discovered him to be the author of one of the cool web coding books on my digital bookshelf, _Simply Javascript_, (published by SitePoint, a great press!). Adams describes himself as a “Web Technologist,” which means “he does graphic design, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, writing, server-side jiggery pokery, and anything else that takes his fancy that day.” I guess that makes him a bit of a mashup himself.

To get back to his visual mashup, though, I like how educational the whole project is. Not only is the end product self-explanatory, but, for the really curious, you can actually dive into the page and dig around for his web source and javascript code to learn how he did it. After all, he mentions on his web site that what you see is all happening in realtime. It’s not a movie file. “The entire piece is composed from the latest HTML5 and CSS3 technology (canvas, audio, transforms & transitions).”
