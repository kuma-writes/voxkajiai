I’m a bit of a sucker for creative experimental art, though much of it fails to really captures my attention long enough to become truly immersed in the experience. This hold true for digital versions as well as physical, real world installations. Going back to the earliest days with interactive CD-Roms, I can remember playing with [Laurie Anderson’s “Puppet Motel”](http://blip.tv/ifbook/voyager-puppet-motel-demo-467399) and thinking to myself how unique it was among other discs that were finding their way to market. \[Does anyone else miss the work of The Voyager Company?\]

Since Apple opened their AppStore, a number of musical artist have released apps to accompany their albums or to provide some kind of connection between audience and artist. Most have simply been attempts to create a sort of interactive liner notes. I’ve downloaded them because I like the artist, but usually they don’t end up living long on my device once I’ve “played” through them.

So, it came as a bit of a surprise to me to discover Björk’s latest project on the iPad, a pre-album release app called _Biophilia_. I downloaded it a couple of days ago, but it sat idle until this weekend when I had a chance to tap on it. I always run a bit hot and cold when it comes to Björk and her music, but I am almost always impressed by her music videos and other projects. Tapping on _Biophilia_ opened up a whirling galaxy of labelled constellations, stars on a black canvas connected with string art into a kinetic mobile-like Rorschach, as a British narrator introduces the project and leads us on a galactic fly-through of the space and invites us to explore it.

At the conclusion of the introduction, I navigate through the environment a bit before aiming toward the constellation burning brightest, a soaring bird-like vision of hash marks with a beaming yellow star at its beak, with the word “crystalline” hovering nearby. Tapping on the star takes me in orbit above the star, as a melody of crystal plinking sounds plays. If I zoom out or swipe slowly in other directions, the sounds of other stars begin to layer, or intrude, on the scene. Tapping the star again, I dive into the star, as a solid color fills the screen along with liner note material, skillfully executed. But not just liner note information. The text describes an interactive experience, a game. And there, on the upper left, a “buy now” option.

Before making an in-app purchase, I explore the rest of the galaxy, each constellation with its own unique melody, text, and app option, and all corresponding to a track on the upcoming album. A persistent icon hovers there in the upper left corner, twisting compass-like as I explore. Tapping it brings up all the track/constellation titles, shortcuts to the stars, and “cosmogong” in bold as the opening number. Tapping that, brings me the liner notes and links to the song’s intro, video, lyrics, credits, musical analysis by [Nikki Dibben](http://www.shef.ac.uk/music/staff/academic/ndibben), music faculty member at The University of Sheffield specializing in music psychology, and versions of the song that playback as animation or with the accompanying score.

Tapping on “crystalline,” I decide to “buy now” and see what is offered. I pause a moment at the price, $1.99, but decide to take the plunge, realizing that, when the album is complete, I may ultimately be out almost $20, which is a bit steep. Once crystalline is purchased, the options are similar to “cosmogong,” with music, animation and more. The “play” option is new, though, and turns out to be a bit of a mashup of a tunnel racer game and [Katamari Damacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy), which has me traveling through multicolor geometric vector tunnels, tilting the ipad in all directions, trying to collect sequences of crystals of various colors, while the “crystalline” song plays in accompaniment. When the run ends, I may have unlocked new tunnels based on the crystal blob I created, and I can even save my crystal creation. Not the most thrilling of games, but this is more of a musical zen experience than a fast-paced shoot-em-up.

Future applets offer the promise of a lightening sound maker, a virus-themed instrument, a music sequencer, a scales tutor, a galactic harp, a fusion between biology and music, and a new musical notation system.

In the end, _Biophilia_ may not be unique as a CD adjunct application with in-app expansion. However, I’m very pleased with its execution and it has succeeded in persuading me to engage with the artist and her music more than I might have otherwise. I just may end up buying more of the expansion applets as they are released, too. Since I will now also look for the disc (or the mp3 album, to be precise) upon its release, I guess I would say that Björk’s _Biophilia_ is a success.
