So, even now my drive commute is fairly short, about 20-25 minutes. That doesn't give me too much time to listen to my Audible books, but I was usually able to get through a book a month. Now that I've become a fan of podcasts, my book subscriptions never get listened to.

What started it all? Leo Laporte's [TWiT](http://twit.tv/) network of "[netcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcast)" and Patrick Norton's [DL.TV](http://dl.tv/) I was preparing for our annual sojourn back to Japan and decided to load up my [Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/) with some podcasts. I had been hearing so much about them but just had not made the time to listen. I had been a fan of Leo and the whole gang on TechTV, before G4 took over and killed most of the good stuff and, thanks to iTunes, I knew that their shows were available for subscription. So, in addition to my Audible book and a couple of CDs worth of music, I threw a couple of hours worth of podcasts onto my iPod.

On the flight over I listened to my book but finished it (it was a 12 hour flight afterall). Then on the train from Hiroshima to the ferry port to Miyajima I bypassed the music and tuned in to DL.TV (the audio version) and was hooked. I knew I was just listening, but it was very comfortable, like tuning in to the old TechTV. I listened to Leo's [KFI The Tech Guy](http://www.twit.tv/KFI) show, [FLOSS Weekly](http://www.twit.tv/FLOSS), the [Daily GizWiz](http://www.twit.tv/DGW) (what a hoot! Go Dick!), [This Week in Tech](http://www.twit.tv/TWiT), and [Security Now](http://www.twit.tv/SN). And then I was bummed when I ran out. Thankfully the hotel had a connection and I could download more, which I did. That got me through the next week when I was without connectivity. Then, the day before heading back to the states I found a hotspot and downloaded enough for the flight back

I've been an avid listener ever since. I branched out to include almost all of the TWiT shows and the [MacCast](http://maccast.com/) for my commutes. I also download a couple of video podcasts for on-screen consumption-[Geek Brief](http://geekbriefwp.podshow.com/), DL.TV, [Ask A Ninja](http://askaninja.com/) and [PixelPerfect](http://www.revision3.com/pixelperfect) on Revision3.

And, it's because of Leo that I'm writing here on Vox. I'm such a TWiT.
