I first met [Chris Gulker](https://inmenlo.com/2010/10/28/inmenlo-founder-chris-gulker-mar-10-1951-oct-27-2010/) at the [New Media Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Media_Consortium) Conference hosted by the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) in Vancouver back in June of 2004. He was working at Adobe at the time and had come to talk about the [Atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Atmosphere) platform that Adobe had acquired and had been building out as a kind of 3D web of connected worlds. This was only my second NMC Conference but I was very interested in immersive technology such as [QuickTimeVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_VR), [Second Life](https://secondlife.com) and other products that were beginning to emerge.

There was gala event, held at the [Museum of Anthropology](https://moa.ubc.ca), and Chris and I struck up a conversation about photography, technology, his work at Adobe, my work in higher education, his blogging on the [Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Frontier) platform developed by [Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer), and the technology of immersive environments. I don't know why my meeting with Chris stood out among everyone one else I had met, but it did. His was a peaceful personality and our conversation flowed easily. He wasn't running around pressing the flesh, he was not beating his drum loudly. He was present, and engaging, and fully participating in our conversation, both sharing and listening.

After the conference I kept his card and began following along with his blog at Gulker.com. It was a delightful mix of photography, gardening, travel, technology, world events, and personal diary. It was a regular read for me, so it was a bit of gut punch when in late October of 2006, Chris [shared](https://gulker.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/my-brain-and-some-news-about-same/) that he had been diagnosed with a malignant glioma brain tumor. 

Over the next several years, Chris continued to blog about all the things he had been blogging about, but also now included his fight against and life with the tumor. It was intensely personal and also very public. And it also created a sense of closeness despite the distance. I followed along for the next four years, until his battle was at an end and Chris was at peace, his wife reporting, ["It's a wrap..."](https://gulker.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/its-a-wrap/) for the final blog entry.

The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) maintains a record of Chris' blog, both the original site (www.gulker.com) and the Wordpress version ([gulker.wordpress.com](https://gulker.wordpress.com)) he migrated to in 2006. I'm glad it persists, and also that the Wordpress site is still online as well.


At this very moment it occurs to me also that he was the same age when I met him as I am now, which hits in a particular way. Chris' blog will always remain a very special place on the Internet for me, connecting me to an individual in a way I had not experienced before then. 

Like old photographs or cards from my son stored in a box, Chris Gulker's site remains in my bookmark list.
