Seems a bit quaint to start a podcast here in 2011, but this is some three years in the making. That doesn't mean it took three years to perfect; it took three years to find the time and commitment to sit in a room and finally do it! Josh Kim is a good friend and colleague of mine, he writes the "[Technology and Learning](http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning)" blog for Inside Higher Ed. It's is our hope to do this more regularly, on a monthly basis at least.

This first episode is a bit long, as we cover our thoughts on the Kindle Fire, HTML5 Video, and our current TV viewing, book reading, game playing, and movie watching lists.

As always, your feedback is appreciated.
