Josh and I were back at the table for another MediaMixED podcast. This time around, we opened with a discussion of "collision spaces," which I mentioned in my previous blog entry, "[Brighter Together](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/brighter-together/ "Brighter Together")." We also touch on Apple's iBooks 2, iBooks Author, and rich media publishing. We were both lucky enough to hear from [Cathy Davidson](http://www.cathydavidson.com/), author of _Now You See It_, when she spoke on campus and we spend several minutes talking about some of the issues she raises.

In our media picks, we suggest _Downton Abbey_, _Sherlock_, _Sons of Anarchy_, _Boardwalk Empire_, and _Hell on Wheels_. There is also a brief mention of the Japanese drama _The Queen's Classroom_ (女王の教室) from 2005.
