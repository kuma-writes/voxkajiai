Our good friend Laura joined Josh and me around the table for our second podcast, recorded just before the holiday break at the end of 2011.

In this episode we discuss some of our holiday traditions before moving on to our regular stew of TV, books and videos. In particular, we talk about our "TV worth watching" and the changing nature of television consumption; then dive in to our reasons and motivations behind why we read what we read. Recently, that has been _Reamde_, _Ready Player One_, _The Marriage Plot_, and _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_.

Do e-books simply NOT offer a better experience to the physical tome? Laura and Josh hit some of the pros and cons of this debate.

In games, _Skyrim_ seems to be the game of the year, but what's available for the family-friendly Wii console that just doesn't suck?

As always, your feedback is appreciated.
