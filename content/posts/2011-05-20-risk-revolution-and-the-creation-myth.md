Malcolm Gladwell recently wrote the article ”Creation Myth: Xerox PARC, Apple, and the truth about innovation" for the May 16th issue of The New Yorker. Although I have not yet read the article in full, I did catch NPR’s _[All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/2011/05/16/136368716/malcolm-gladwell-looks-at-technology-innovations)_ from the same date, in which host Robert Siegel [interviews](http://www.npr.org/2011/05/16/136368716/malcolm-gladwell-looks-at-technology-innovations) Gladwell about the topic. I will definitely seek the full article (and may even download the issue as a first for my iPad), but a few quotes from the interview stood out for me.

Gladwell describes Steve Jobs’ visit to Xerox PARC and how he comes away, not as a “thief,” as some portray him, but as someone who realizes that the clunky mouse he has just seen needs to be dramatically transformed in order to make it both useful and commercially viable. Gladwell goes on to say, “...we shouldn't think about revolutions having an inventor. We should only think of them as having _**inventors**_,” \[emphasis mine\] and “ I think that we wrongly fetishize being first in a technological revolution....”

I work in higher education, at a school that is famous as one of the early innovators and early adopters of technology. These days, however, it seems like we are consuming more technology than we produce, in terms of either innovation or evolution. We now spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on the “safety” of “enterprise solutions.” It may kill me to say it, but I can get over that for the most part. After all, we’re talking about the “tools” of the trade of modern education.

But, even though we may have given up on developing the tools, we in education cannot give up on being party to the revolution. How we educate cannot go backwards. The world has changed too much, and our education systems need to continue to evolve to meet the challenges. We have all these “tools” available to us, but we need to develop more revolutionaries. We need a larger cadre of innovative teachers. There are many of them out there, don’t get me wrong. What I mean, though, is that I want more of them on my campus, and on yours.

Higher ed today is not about revolution. The safest route to tenure is the quietest one. Not only do I want more faculty to take risks with their teaching, to try new things, to get help and advice on teaching and learning, but I also want our students to graduate with the courage to take risks and try new things in their fields. I want them to have learned how to take the risks, and to value and appreciate what that means when others do so.

There are essays and books that talk about our nation’s top students not as being necessarily the smartest or most innovative, but as the ones who have “figured out” how the system works and who do as little as possible to score the grades that they need. These are not the risk takers that will drive our planet forward. We don’t need our students to jump in front of bullets, but we need our graduates to understand that the safest route is not always the best route.

They should see that, too, in the classroom, from their teachers. Education is messy. There is no one “way” to teach or to learn. Unfortunately, far too many instructors stand before their students, deliver the material, and hope they get it. That’s neither evolution nor revolution.

There is no law, like NCLB, that will “create” an educated citizenry. Nor will there be one individual who comes up with THE best way to teach. So, what can I do to fan the flames of a creative revolution in teaching and learning? What do you do where you are?
