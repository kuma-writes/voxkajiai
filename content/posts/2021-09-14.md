Over the past decade I have completed several python short courses, but I know from my personal experience as well as my experience as an instructor that learning without ongoing application and usage will undermine the learning. Somewhere buried in the brain the information still sits, but the neural networks were simply not reinforced enough to transform the information into knowledge.

Nonetheless, here I go again. This time, maybe, I'll put the information to use. I'm interested in using python both for data science explorations and also for more fun projects with hardware using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org).

Before diving back in, I asked the Internet, via Google, to tell me which online Python courses were the best. Luckily, I had already purchased a few in the past couple of years so it was simply a matter of logging back in.

I decided to start with the big one. Udemy's [*Learn Python Programming Masterclass*](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/) is a comprehensive, 67-hour, 492 lecture behemoth of a course taught by Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul Roberts.

I'm currently 3 hours in and, while most of it is foundational and familiar for most programming languages, there are already things I'm either learning for the first time or resurfacing from past experience.

If I get through this one, I want to take a look at [*The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications*](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/). Though, judging by some of the apps, I may actually jump between the two courses.
