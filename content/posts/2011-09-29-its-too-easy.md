I know that is a vague title for a blog post, but with Amazon’s tablet lineup [announcements](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1610968&highlight=) yesterday, it was just too easy to go for a title that plays on the Doors’ hit song, “Light My Fire.” So, I deliberately am not going there.

Nevertheless, it is also pretty easy to be enamored of Amazon’s new color touch tablet, the [Kindle Fire](http://amzn.com/B0051VVOB2). With its price point ($199), processing power (Dual-core CPU), screen resolution (1024x600), weight (14.6 ounces) and the full array of Amazon’s cloud-based services (books, music, video, apps), it appears to be a worthy alternative to the iPad. While I’m not convinced it will be the iPad-killer, it should take a big bite out of the tablet market.

I’ve been an iPad user now for about a year and a half. Early on, my concerns were about productivity and whether or not the iPad could replace my laptop. With the release of the iPad 2, it has actually become my primary portable work device, the one I take to most meetings instead of a laptop. I can check e-mail, compose documents, read documents sent to me, surf the web and more. Except for an occasional Netflix movie, it rarely gets used as the entertainment device it once was, for me. And, it belongs to the College.

Now, I may be in the market for a device for me, for my personal use, bought with my own money. The iPad, as much as I enjoy, is still a bit hard to justify at $500. The Kindle Fire hits the sweet spot, and I really think I can live without 3G features and cameras if it delivers on it other promises. I switched to Amazon for my music purchases years ago; I’ve already purchased a number of Kindle book titles; and my Amazon Prime account renews annually, providing free 2-day shipping and now an alternative to Netflix for movies and TV shows, that even play on my Roku. Plus, I already have an Android phone, so I’m already fairly comfortable with the OS.

With Christmas around the corner, the Amazon Kindle Fire may yet find its way under the tree.

It’s just too easy...
