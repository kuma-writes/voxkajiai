I recently had occasion to revisit using iMovie to edit a recorded play performance. When you are editing a recorded performance, you are usually working with either multiple recordings of the same performance (ideally) or trying to splice together multiple recordings of the performance over several shows.

The former is similar to live editing a television broadcast, switching between cameras and calling shots to the camera operators in preparation for a switch. The performance is singular and you get lucky if you can capture the right angle at just the right moment.

The latter resembles how one puts together a film. You setup your location, set your cameras, and have your actors run through their performance several times. Then you switch camera positions and have the actors run their performances again. You may do this many times depending on the angles that the director wants to incorporate into the final production. Then, in editing, the best of the bits and pieces are put together. Much like film and video offer the illusion of motion by quickly presenting multiple still images, this kind of editing creates the illusion of a single “performance.”

When you are a parent recording your child’s school performance, you generally only get the one chance, so there is very little to work with after the fact. You can strip out the filler of the teacher’s comments or the solo performance by the golden child of the school, but in general we either capture the whole show or just our child’s performance. And then, most of us probably do the pan left-pan right, or zoom in-zoom out work necessary to focus our attention on our children. Of course, all of that panning and zooming can be hell to work with if you ever do get down to editing, though we probably never will.

I think this is why we all have so many boxes of video tapes, flash cards, or DVDs that have never been edited. For most of us, film and video are really no different from the shoebox of photos under the bed (for older readers) or the ever expanding hard drives full of digital photos. They are the backups of our physical life experiences--unedited.

We know from brain science that our brains are very different from the shoebox or hard drive. Our brains are editing the memories, distilling them into a fine liqueur. But I’m ok with that. At least for now, I have both--the pleasurable brain edits, and the raw footage.
