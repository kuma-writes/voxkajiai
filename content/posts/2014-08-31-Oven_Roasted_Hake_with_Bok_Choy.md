*Yield*: 4 dinner servings

__INGREDIENTS__

* 1 green onion, sliced thin
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 1/4 cup lime juice
* 3 tablespoons gluten-free soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
* 3 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil (divided)
* Kosher salt and pepper for seasoning
* 1 pound baby bok choy, cut lengthwise
* 1 pound hake or other white fish, cut into single portion sizes
* 1/2 cup cooking sake or dry white wine

__PREPARATION__

1. Preheat oven to 400ÂºF, rack in upper third of oven.
2. In a small bowl, combine green onion, cilantro, lime juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and ginger. Whisk in 1 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil and season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat remaining oil in cast iron skillet on high heat until shimmering. Gradually add bok choy cut side down and sear until golden brown. Work in batches, turning bok choy as needed until all are seared and just starting to become tender. Remove skillet from heat.
4. Season hake with salt and pepper on each side. Layer hake on top of bok choy. Pour sake over fish and bok choy evenly.
5. Roast in oven for approximately 10 minutes, until fish is cooked through and flaky.
6. Remove from oven. Divide sake cooking liquid into 4 serving dishes or bowls. Divide bok choy evenly and top with hake portions. Spoon cilantro-lime sauce over fish and bok choy.
7. Serve with brown rice. (Rice can be at the bottom of each bowl for a delicious one-dish serving).
