As mentioned yesterday, I've been doing a bit of housekeeping on my iMac and turned my attention to my internet browser bookmarks, which can often be a place where memories go to die rather than live again. You know the feeling, you're web surfing and come across a particularly useful or interesting site and decide to bookmark it to revisit later. Except, we don't often actually get around to the actual revisiting part of the process. Nevertheless, like using Google Streetview to stroll through one's childhood neighborhood, I decided to perform that particular trip down the Internet memory lane to see what my old brain remembered, to see what still lived, changed or otherwise.

I do remember, actually, about a decade ago attempting to create a single set of bookmarks that I could use across all of my browsers and spent no small amount of time organizing folders and links. I even downloaded some applications to help remove duplicates or dead links, though I'd be hard-pressed to name even one of those tools now. The problem that I ran into, however, was that each browser wanted to handle the bookmarks in just a slightly different way, most notably naming the the collection of link as either bookmarks or favorites, referring to the privileged few to live on the "favorites bar" or "bookmarks toolbar" or something else. So, right out of the box you can't have just one set of consistent links. So, that certainly worked against a unified approach.

Then, some of you may recall, there was, for a while, the very popular [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) website that allowed you to externalize your bookmarks to a hosted service. As an early social network service, you could share your bookmarks as well. People started including their delicio.us link on business cards and websites, too. Unfortunately, the free service was acquired by Yahoo! and then passed around like a [white elephant gift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange) for a few years until its demise in 2017.[^1]

But back to the cleaning project. With del.icio.us gone, I have mostly relied on my search engines to take me back to interesting sites, acknowledging that I may lose some to the fog of memory. Every now and then, though, I will find myself down a particular rabbit hole that may lead me back to my bookmarks, either to create a new folder or to revisit old ones. That has not happened recently, however. I should say that the rabbit hole journeys continue, but without the bookmarks.

Tackling the list, I opened up two separate browser windows, one to edit the bookmarks, and another to follow them from the sidebar. In the editing window, I expanded each folder and performed a cursory review to remove "feed:" links and links to commercial sites that I have no need to ever visit, and which probably only existed as a set of defaults that once came pre-installed with a browser. These include network sites like ABC, CBS, and NBC, sports sites like ESPN that I never visited, a few entertainment/gossip sites like E!, some weather sites, several news sites like CNN, FoxNews, and the New York Times, and perhaps some educational sites like National Geographic, or NatGeo as it is often referred to now. I'm not linking any of those sites here since there is simply no need.

With those sites eliminated and almost like performing tombstone rubbings, I began to click on the remaining links to see which ones still existed. Unsurprisingly, there were a number of dead links, but many of the sites still existed, frozen in time, alive, but in suspended animation. After all, someone is still paying to renew the domain on these sites, even if the content hasn't been updated in a decade.

There's [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/), [Blogs of War](https://blogsofwar.com/), [Christopher Lydon Interviews](http://blogs.harvard.edu/lydondev/), and [The Creative Science Centre by Dr. Jonathan Hare](http://www.creative-science.org.uk/main.html), all in their late-90s/early-00's web glory.

There's the collection of blogs and forums for expatriates in Japan, including [F*cked Gaijin](https://www.fuckedgaijin.com/forums/), Kurt Easterwood's [HMMN](http://www.easterwood.org/hmmn/), and Mike Clarke's [Hunkabutta](http://hunkabutta.com). There's also Japanophile pages like [Japan Zone](https://www.japan-zone.com), the forum for Eurasians, [EurasianNation](https://eurasiannation.proboards.com), and the mothballed, but still dark, Asian Extreme Cinema review site of Mandi Apple, [Snowblood Apple](http://www.mandiapple.com/snowblood/index2.htm).

I remember attending an educational technology conference and learning about [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/), a tool for creating interactive fiction. Naturally, there are a few examples on the list, including Andrew Plotkin's [Shade](https://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/shade/), Shawn Graham's [Stranger in These Parts](https://playfic.com/games/shawn_graham/stranger-in-these-parts---v01), and Adam Cadre's [9:05](http://adamcadre.ac/if/905.html). If those interest you, follow the breadcrumbs back to [Zarf's Interactive Fiction](https://eblong.com/zarf/if.html), [playfic](https://playfic.com), and Adam's [interactive fiction](http://adamcadre.ac/if.html) pages, respectively.

In the realm of non-interactive fiction, there are literature review sites like the [Los Angeles Review of Books](https://lareviewofbooks.org/), [n+1](https://nplusonemag.com/), [The Millions](https://themillions.com), and Kim Ukura's [Sophisticated Dorkiness](https://sophisticateddorkiness.com).

Among some of the grab bag selection of sites are the [MSSIAH Cartridge (formerly Prophet64)](https://www.mssiah.com/), a MIDI hardware cartridge for the Commodore 64, the very problematic language experiment [The Dialectizer](http://rinkworks.com/dialect/dialectp.cgi?dialect=redneck&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicro.magnet.fsu.edu%2Fprimer%2Fmuseum%2Fhooke.html), an Urban Dictionary-like site called [Word Spy](https://wordspy.com/), the [Freedom From Religion Foundation](https://ffrf.org/), and remember [LYCOS](https://www.lycos.com)?

For me it has been an interesting trip to revisit these sites. Some I have kept in my bookmarks list, and others I've let go. And there are a couple more that I simply cannot let go of, but I'll cover those in the next entry tomorrow.
