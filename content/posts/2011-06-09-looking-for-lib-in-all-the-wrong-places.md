A good friend of mine is always pushing me in positive ways. Now that I’m in the Library, he’s really helping to push me to defend, promote, transform and reveal the Library, using my position as outside insider. I do my best, but I have to wonder if he’s right about the Library profession seeming to be a secret society. It’s ironic, too, because, as just about any librarian will tell you, they are here to illuminate the paths to knowledge and information, and they go above and beyond to help connect you with the information that you seek.

So, why do I allude to some kind of secrecy to their craft? Perhaps it is because the library does not seem to be the subject often enough of “pop“ scholarship. What they do, why they are still valuable to society, and the issues that affect the library are not the stuff of books that are finding their way to the bookstore shelves or the New York Times Bestsellers list. Where are the _Blink, Outliers,_ or _Freakonomics_ titles about the library? Where are the interesting survey books about the leading university libraries in the country or the turnaround stories about the head librarians who have rescued and reimagined their libraries for the 21st century?

There is so much happening in the library space today, as libraries struggle to redefine their mission and their audience, and to justify their continued existence. To non-librarians, libraries are still viewed primarily as book warehouses run by mature women with their hair in a bun who have nothing better to do than to go around ”shh“-ing patrons. That image couldn’t be farther from the truth.

Although I work in a library, I am not a librarian, so I feel ill-equipped to fully describe ”the library today.“ What I do know is that, at academic institutions at least:

- Libraries continue to build their collections to facilitate ongoing research in all fields of campus scholarship, although more and more is shifting to digital format.
- They are partners with faculty in teaching courses and in guiding students to the materials they need to complete course research projects.
- They are training students, faculty, and staff how to use equipment, such as digital video cameras, audio recorders, and digital still cameras, and are teaching them how to use the software that enables them to edit, organize and present the digital recordings that they make as part of their personal projects and course assignments.
- They are involved in securing our history and culture through efforts to preserve physical items and to digitize as many assets in their current holdings as possible to make them more widely available for research.
- They are in the trenches on the front lines in the battles for reasonable and informed copyright law.

\[This last point in particular is a major piece that affects so many areas of the library and academic scholarship that I’ll leave it to a second post.\]

The point is, if you’re a librarian, you probably already know the activities of your library and the world of your professional community. You attend workshops and conferences, and you probably know exactly what journals and web sites to read to stay informed.

But, to the outsider, if we are looking for information _**about**_ the modern library, we must be looking in all the wrong places, because clearly the ”Esoterism“ of the library is not finding its way to a mainstream audience. That is something that I hope will change. Maybe I can even be a part of it.

\[P.S. If you can point me to some mainstream titles, I’d be grateful.\]
