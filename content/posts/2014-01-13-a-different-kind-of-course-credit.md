Here’s a thought...

Movies and television shows (and even video games) offer viewers an experience over a period of time. At the end, even if you don't stay tuned until the lights come up or the commercial break begins, the credits roll, listing all the people who have helped bring that experience to the audience.

Courses, too, offer an experience over a period of time and are rarely prepared and delivered wholly through the efforts of one person. Why then do courses not include credits? After all, for many people outside of higher ed, there is often a lack of understanding about what is actually involved in teaching today. More importantly there is a lack of understanding about how many people are involved in “producing” a course.

Yes, I realize that unions are primarily responsible for making sure everyone is credited in an entertainment industry production. But, when someone asks why a blockbuster film costs so much, it is pretty easy to point to the credits to show all the people that needed to be paid in order to bring that film to the screen.

But for courses, other than the professor, what about acknowledging the librarians, the library staff, the instructional designers, the LMS administrators, and others who have played some direct role in helping to deliver that course?

Just about the only time anyone seems to publicly acknowledge the various people who indirectly contribute to the education a person receives is when a class valedictorians has their brief moment at the podium to thank “all the teachers and administrators” for helping get them where they are. But let’s face it, that’s like the opening credits of season one of “Gilligan’s Island,” in which the Professor and Mary Ann are reduced to “...and the rest.”

This isn’t about ego, it’s about recognition. Students earn course credit. Faculty are credited as course owners. Maybe it’s high time for giving credit where credit is long overdue.

Of course, the tricky part may be figuring out whom to include and where exactly to let these particular credits roll.
