The plan for day 1 was to start setting up my collection of Raspberry Pi devices, both as a project just to put them to use, but also to serve as the basis for some Linux and development training/refreshing. I pulled out the collection, 2 x Pi 2B+, 1 x Pi 3B+, and 1 Pi 4, the newly purchased mini 5-port network switch, an [Anker PowerPort 6](https://us.anker.com/products/a2123) USB charging hub, an assortment of 12" ethernet cables and 12" microUSB cables[^1], and I began rummaging through my box of microSD cards and adapters.

I started with the Pi 3 since I knew I had used it about six months ago. I booted it up to confirm the card inside was running [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/), which it was. I powered down, removed the card, and set it aside for safe keeping. I downloaded the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and set out to make my first card of the day. And, it failed.

Next, I examined the microSD cards I had and popped one of the first I found into my iMac. I noted the familiar "boot" partition, noticed the file dates were also from about six months ago, so I unmounted it and slid it into the SD card slot of my newer Pi 2B, connected the various power, USB, and display cables, including my switched mouse and keyboard, and powered it up. It booted to a Buster desktop and I proceeded to run the necessary

```
sudo apt-get update
```
and
```
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
commands and let the debian environment do its thing.

While that was running, I turned my attention to the next card I found, which turned out to be an old Android card. I ran the Raspberry Pi Imager application ready to burn the first of what I thought would be several cards for the day. Instead, I received an error. So I then tried [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), but I needed to download the latest [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) image file, which also took some time. Remembering that the Pi 2B is not particularly peppy, I also downloaded the [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) version of the Pi image as well. Yet, Etcher also failed, so I tried Disk Utility, which also failed. No matter what I attempted, the existing content refused to be overwritten. I was able to remove most of the files, but nearly 3GB of the data simply refused to go away. Then, I was starting to have vague memories of this happening before. 

I booted up my Windows 10 machine to give its tools a try. I tried Windows Disk Management. I tried Diskpart. I ran chkdsk. I tried different SD card adapters. I tried a microSD card reader. I toggled the write-protect switch on the adapters. I tried just about everything short of downloading a third-party tool. Nothing was successful. I even went back to the Mac and tried a few more tools there, all with no luck.

In the meantime, the Raspian Lite image completed, and I located another card, which I was able to successfully image with Etcher. I spent the next hour or so getting the second Pi 2B up and running, updated, and installed Pi-Hole on it. I then worked on both of the Pi 2Bs to get them a little more secure, and accessible via SSH and, for one, VNC.

During my Etcher runs I noticed their advertisement for [balenaSound](https://sound.balenalabs.io/), an image to use a Raspberry Pi as a multi-platform streaming audio device, and decided to download it to test on one of the Pis. I located another SD card, one that clearly had been in a Raspberry Pi before, and set about to etching it. Only, it too failed. Lather, rinse, repeat the efforts from the morning. This card refused to give up its partitions or be reformatted.

In frustration, I needed a diversion, so I decided it was time to pull out the [Edifier shelf speakers](https://edifier-online.com/us/en/speakers/studio-r1280t-2.0-powered-bookshelf-speakers) and get them set up in my office space anyway. I connected them to my Echo Dot, and filled the room with music. I also tidied up the office a bit as well.

Toward the end of the day, I had my first meeting with a career coach who had been recommended to me by a friend. [Janice Jaguszewski](https://www.janicej-consulting.com/) and I had a great conversation. Originally scheduled for an hour, we spoke for nearly 90 minutes. We learned we had a lot in common and she encouraged me in saying that I was much further along the path than many people with whom she's worked. She reminded me of a few options I can begin to pursue as I explore some alternatives for the road ahead.

Finally, just after dinner time, UPS delivered my new iPad Pro 11, so I spent most of the rest of the evening, getting it set up for use and installing the software that I felt would be essential. I also went online and ordered a cover, screen protector, fake Apple pencil, oh, and that 12" USB-C cable referenced in the footnote.
