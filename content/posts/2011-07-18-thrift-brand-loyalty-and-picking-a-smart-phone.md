I have been an [Apple](http://www.apple.com/)customer since 1993, when I purchased my first Macintosh at the start of grad school, and began programming on Apple computers back with the \]\[e. While I have built and rebuilt several Windows systems for my personal use, my platform of choice remains the fruit vendor’s OS. Choosing to use Apple has never been about thrift. Rather, it has been about multilingual processing, avoiding viruses and trojans, and, frankly, “fit.” The only place where “thrift” entered into the argument was in saving time lost on maintenance rather than in saving money on the initial investment.

As Apple entered the portable music player market, both brand loyalty and thrift played a role. Few early mp3 players played nice with Apple hardware, but an mp3 player itself didn’t warrant a full switch to Windows. But for my “needs,” I couldn’t justify the cost of the early iPods. So I waited and was eventually rewarded with the [iPod Shuffle](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1353#ipodshuffle), which hit the sweet spot. \[Side note: I still used my original iPod shuffle until 1 month ago, when it finally decided not to be seen when plugged into the USB port\]. Later, with points saved on my credit card, I finally bought an [iPod video](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1353#ipodfifth), which I still use today.

Then, Apple upped the game again with the [iPod Touch](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1353#ipodtouch), offering more than just music, but portable computing as well. And I’ve been a loyal Touch user since 2007.

The iPhone, however, is another story, and here, “thrift” kicks in.

While much of my time is spent online, I’m not an avid cell phone user. Where I have lived and worked has not really required me to have a particularly mobile lifestyle, and the people I call the most are members of my family. I have never been able to justify a cellular telephone “plan,” with a two-year locked-in contract, in our family budget. So, since 2003-4, my family have been customers of [Virgin Mobile USA](http://www.virginmobileusa.com/), using inexpensive phones, pre-paid, no-contract service. We began with plans that required no more than $20 every three months! To date, we have rarely gone beyond that, although we have replaced our phones four times since we started. Our most recent phones cost us $10 and I pay only $20 every two months.

But, the story doesn’t end there.

I have been itching for a smart phone. More accurately, I’ve been itching for a hand-held mobile computing device with a camera, WiFi and 3G service that fits in my pocket. I really could care less about the “phone” functionality, but the combination seems to mandate that it be a phone.

The iPad is great, but it doesn’t fit in my pocket. The new iPod Touch would be great, too, but it doesn’t have 3G service. And, even with a college employee discount, I just can’t make the argument, still, for the cell phone plan that an iPhone (3GS or 4) purchase would require. So, Apple, while I love your devices, I can’t afford to pay for the monkey on its back that is an AT&T or Verizon contract.

On Friday, thrift and my cell phone service loyalty found me as the owner of a brand new [LG Optimus V](http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/lg-optimus-v-phone.jsp) Android-based smart phone from Virgin Mobile USA. I wanted to wait until the iPhone 5 announcement became official, but Virgin is changing its service plan this week and I decided to “lock in” for as long as possible to its “unlimited” [Beyond Talk](http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phone-plans/beyond-talk-plans.jsp) service. For $25 a month I’m offered unlimited text, email, data and web, along with 300 talk minutes (which I will never use up!).

The Optimus is certainly no iPhone (which may merit a blog post on its own), but it is a full-featured smartphone. While I honestly feel just a tinge “unclean” in breaking from Apple, I’m sure I’ll get over it when I see my cell statement. Oh, right, I don’t have one.

Now, how do I get this on my campus network, mail and VPN?
