There is an interesting [article](http://t.co/SOZzdBkl) in the Wall Street Journal about the Department of Justice's ongoing investigation into possible price collusion among Apple and leading publishers with the release of Apple's iBooks app on the iPad. At issue is the shift from a "wholesale model" to an "agency model" and Apple's insistence that an ebook could not be sold for less by rival retailers. The deal gave Apple its 30% and kept prices high for publishers, who then imposed the model on other ebook sellers, most notably Amazon. [![](http://mediamixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/erasedrights.png?w=300 "Rights Eraser")](http://mediamixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/erasedrights.png)

While I'm glad this has caught the attention of the DOJ, I'm still less than pleased that ebooks are essentially sold to consumers under a "license" agreement model, which undermines the [first-sale doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine) and prevents the sharing, trading, and reselling of text that would apply to physical books. Once again, it seems that consumers are getting the raw end of the deal. The software industry began taking away consumer protections with the nefarious "click-through" agreements. The videogaming industry now sells you content on a physical disc that can only be "unlocked" with an additional purchase, effectively making you pay twice for the same object. And there is still the infamous Amazon [remote deletion](http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/17/amazon-why-dont-you-come-in-our-houses-and-burn-our-books-too/) of "1984" and "Animal Farm" from consumer's Kindles. Who's supposed to investigate those collusive practices?

Our Faustian bargain with industry returns again and again, as we trade away our long-term rights for short-term convenience with the click of the mouse or a tap on the "buy now" button.
