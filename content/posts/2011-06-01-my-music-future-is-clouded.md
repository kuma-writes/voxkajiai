Yesterday we read of Apple’s announcement that Steve Jobs will address the assembled loyal at the WWDC event this summer, and that he will be talking about the rumored iCloud service. Details beyond that are not yet forthcoming, but [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and [Google](http://music.google.com/)both went to the cloud earlier this Spring.

Amazon offers 5GB initially, but a simple album purchase will expand the amount to 20GB and more space can be purchased. You access your music with a web-based cloud player, thought there is an Android app to access your music on the go. There is uploader application to move your existing music to your _amazon cloud drive_. The application will scan your computer for music and playlists and will even report which ones cannot be uploaded, either for DRM reasons (all my legacy iTunes purchases) or for size or format issues. Unfortunately, one DRM song in a playlist makes the whole playlist ineligible. And, while new song purchases through Amazon do not impact the 20GB of storage, I’m a bit miffed that they are not including all your previous Amazon mp3 purchases. I made the switch for iTunes to Amazon several years ago and Amazon knows every song I’ve purchased, even reminding me before I accidentally try to purchase the song again, so this limitation just doesn’t make any sense to me.

As with many of Google’s services, it’s [Google Music](http://music.google.com/) cloud product is in limited beta release for now, but provides space for up to 20,000 songs. LifeHacker has a good [first look](http://lifehac.kr/lzJXlj) at the service. Like Amazon, there is a Music Manager tool and an Android app to access your music on the go. One nice feature of the Google Music Manager tool is its ability to watch a folder for new music changes and automatically upload them to your cloud account. It’s player will offer Genius-like mixes and other features. I’m still waiting for my beta invite, but just reading about the polish on the Google Music web player makes me eager to give it a try.

But, by the end of summer, I’ll be in a real quandary when it comes to my music collection. Where exactly do I want to keep my music for remote access? Right now, I’m actually running the [Orb server](http://www.orb.com/) on a machine at home, which gives me access just about anywhere I have an Internet connection. But, I do have to copy new music to it as it runs all alone on a box in the corner of the room, and it doesn’t see all of my iTunes playlists, which is a downside.

As a long-time [MobileMe](http://www.me.com/) account holder (back to the beginning, when it was free, and before it was called MobileMe), I’m very curious to learn the details of the iCloud service. With both Amazon and Google, I would need to upload my music, which could take quite a while. Since Apple acquired LaLa, there is the possibility that the iCloud service will simply scan my collection and make it available to me online, which would be a time saver. Also, I feel that Apple is more likely to release an app for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch devices as well, which Amazon and Google do not yet have. But, then again, I’m also a Roku owner, and who will play first on my Roku device?

Ah, the paralysis of choice! For now, I just don’t know. I will continue to buy music from Amazon, and will continue to download a copy for my offline use and mobile devices, but the future of my music collection is definitely still clouded.

Are you dealing with the same conundrums? Have you decided where your music collection will live? Let me know.
