J. Angelo Racoma at [Forever Geek](https://web.archive.org/web/20061016093020/http://forevergeek.com/apple/mac_vs_windows_its_all_about_the_maximize_button.php) pointed me in the direction of another blog at [Restiffbard](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029044537/http://restiffbard.com/archives/2006/09/15/windows-goes-full-os-x-goes-small/), and both deal with the simple difference in how Windows and Mac differ on a feature as simple as maximizing a window and how users operate given this behavior of the OS.

For those who may only have experience with one platform or the other, clicking the maximize button in the top right of a Windows window (next to the "x" close button) will make the active window fill the screen, completely obscuring everthing but the task bar. On a Macintosh, clicking the green maximize button in the top left of a window will zoom the window to maximally contain the contents of the window.

I work on both platforms throughout the day, and although I've adapted to each, both behaviors please and aggravate me depending on the circumstance, though as a longer term Mac user, I am more accustomed to that platform's approach. For me, in general, the primary reason I need to maximize any window is to see as much of the contents as will fit on the screen. Web-page too wide to fit the window? Maximize it. Document text slipping past the viewable margins? Maximize it. Zoomed photo not fitting? Maximize it. Scrolling through icons in a folder? Maximize it. And so on.

Back when monitors were only 800 x 600, this behavior on either platform worked about the same. Now that we are at 1280 x 1024 standard and higher, the Windows version of this tends to annoy me more. The problem? I don't need 4 inches of gray gutter around my documents in Word. I just want my document to fit the necessary space. The same with web pages, PDFs, and Windows Explorer. I do tend to multitask, with a number of windows in different applications open simultaneously and I am often comparing, copying, or referring to the contents of all of them, so I will often resize and position windows to accomodate this mode of working. At least once a day while on my PC I will accidentally hit the maximize button (or double-click the title bar) and BOOM, all windows save one are blocked. I know that clicking again will restore it, but I do find it frustrating, especially when the zoomed window invariably shows nothing but vast areas of white space.

So, when do I like the full-screen effect? When I am absolutely, positively working with a single application on a project requiring concentration. When I am reading a PDF on screen. And, when I am watching a DVD. In short, when I am uni-tasking. Except for the last one, that's when the Mac maximize fails me, and it is click-and-drag-to-resize time.

What about you?
