*Yield:* 4 – 5 cups before adding paneer

__INGREDIENTS__

* 2 tablespoons ghee or oil (I use grapeseed)
* ½ teaspoon asafetida (hing)
* 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 large yellow or red onion, roughly chopped (2 cups)
* 1 pinch of coarse sea salt
* 3-inch piece ginger, peeled and diced small (1/4 cup)
* 10 cloves garlic, peeled and diced (1/4 cup)
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 2 teaspoons coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon red chile powder or cayenne
* 2 large tomatoes, roughly diced (2 cups)
* 1 cup water, divided
* 1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 heaping tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves, crushed slightly in one hand to release flavor (optional) *
* 2-5 green Thai, Serrano, or cayenne chiles, stems removed and chopped
* 2 teaspoons coarse sea salt
* 12 packed cups fresh spinach, washed
* ½ – 1 cup cream, cashew cream, soy/almond milk, or coconut milk
* 2 heaping cups diced paneer or baked tofu **

__PREPARATION__

1. Heat ghee or oil over medium-high heat.
2. Add asafetida, cumin and turmeric. Cook 40 seconds until the seeds turn reddish brown. Mix to coat seeds with oil and avoid burning and sticking.
3. Add onion and pinch of salt. Cook and mix until the onion browns slightly, about 3 minutes.
4. Add ginger and garlic. Cook another minute.
5. Add garam masala, coriander, and red chile. Cook another 40 seconds. Be careful not to burn the spices.
6. Add tomatoes and ½ cup water. Cook 2 minutes.
7. Add tomato paste, ½ cup water, fenugreek, green chiles, and salt. Cook until blended, about 3 minutes. Mixing occasionally.
8. Slowly add spinach, mixing until you have it all in the pan. Cook uncovered until the spinach cooks down, about 8 minutes.
9. Turn heat off, let the mixture cool a few minutes and then blend down. Use an immersion blender or transfer to a food processor or blender, and pulse until all ingredients break down and blend together. Here, use your own judgment. If you like it smooth, process it more. If you like texture, just pulse it a bit. Don’t blend it down at all if you really like texture. *** 
10. Transfer back to you pan and simmer on medium heat another 5 – 6 minutes until all the ingredients, including the spices pull together.
11. Add cream and paneer or tofu. Cook through and serve immediately with basmati rice, roti, or naan.
 
__NOTES__

* If using canned tomatoes, cut the water down by half.
* Thus far, I’ve only found dried Fenugreek Leaves in Indian grocery stores. Traditionally they are called Kasoori Methi. Leave them out if you can’t find them!
* Baked Tofu. This recipe is in Vegan Indian Cooking on page 68. Take one 14-oz. package of firm or extra firm tofu, and slice into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lightly spray a baking sheet. Lay strips on it and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, flipping once in between. You can also season the tofu with salt and garam masala before baking.
