Of course I'm being facetious when I ask that question, but I do recall that one of the absolute simplest origami models I've seen was a small square of paper folded down along a single corner-to-corner diagonal crease. It works, as a sitting dog, a baby chick, or one of a myriad other interpretations, because that is, ultimately, what origami is all about. How can I fold this two dimensional piece of paper in such a way that it conjures for the viewer the appearance or the essence of something else?

We are in a completely new origami universe today, one in which realism seems to lead the field, and I completely get it. The fandom has, in large part, skated to where that particular puck has been sliding for quite some time. 

I bring up origami as, perhaps, the last of my posts regarding the project to weed my browser bookmarks. The folder with the largest number of links, and the folder in which all but one or two were still active, is my origami folder.

I've been folding ever since I was handed my first origami book back in the mid-1970s. I can't recall the title, but I can still see the gloss on the cover of the thin paperback, as well as the bamboo illustrated background. While most of the models were pretty simple for my 8-9 year-old self, the one I challenged to fold was the crane, though unfortunately what I had learned to mastery was the easier flapping bird variation, rather than the ori-tsuru that was far more common when I found myself in Japan more than a decade later.

As I got older, I acquired more books. I remember one of my first big tomes was Kunihiko Kasahara's original hardcover [*Origami Omnibus*](https://www.giladorigami.com/BO_Omnibus.html). The next landmark book was Robert Lang's [*The Complete Book of Origami*](https://www.giladorigami.com/BO_Complete_Lang.html). Next came Jun Maekawa's [*Viva Origami*](https://www.giladorigami.com/BO_Viva_Origami.html), which was edited by Kasahara. But, *Origami Omnibus* was also responsible for introducing me Mitsunobu Sonobe's unit origami, which naturally then flowed to Tomoko Fuse's books on [unit or modular origami](https://www.giladorigami.com/origami-database-book/1434/Unit-Origami-(Japanese)-by-Tomoko-Fuse). And folders continued to up the game. While Steve and Megumi Biddle's [*The New Origami*](https://www.giladorigami.com/BO_NewOrigami.html) introduced new models that leaned more toward simpler, elegant, and fun models, David Brill's [*Brilliant Origami*](https://www.giladorigami.com/BO_Brilliant.html) presented a range from simple to, yes, brilliant. And the library of books continues to grow. My last acquisitions were Makoto Yamaguchi's two volume series [*The Beauty of Origami*](https://www.giladorigami.com/origami-database-book/2635/The-Beauty-of-Origami-by-Makoto-Yamaguchi) and [*The Graceful of Origami*](https://www.giladorigami.com/origami-database-book/3113/The-Graceful-of-Origami-by-Makoto-Yamaguchi).

Needless to say, while I was never a great folder, my interest has never waned, which is why the origami websites remain a good size part of my bookmarked pages. They include:

- [The British Origami Society](http://britishorigami.info/)
- [OrigamiUSA](https://origamiusa.org)
- [Robert J. Lang's Origami](https://langorigami.com)
- [Japan Origami Academic Society](https://origami.jp) (in Japanese)
- [Origami Heaven](http://www.origamiheaven.com)
- [Origami Resource Center](https://origami-resource-center.com)
- [Origami with Rachel Katz](https://origamiwithrachelkatz.oriland.com)
- [Kusudama me!](https://kusudama.me)
- Meenakshi Mukerji's [Origamee](https://origamee.net)
- [Jim Plank's Origami Page (Modular)](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/origami/)
- and the [Origami Database](https://oriwiki.com)

There are, of course, many more site, books, models, and artists, along with YouTube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=origami). I'm simply glad that the community has grown as large as it has and is such a vibrant artistic hub, despite the ugliness of what has transpired around conventions and some leaders within the community during the past several years.

If you haven't seen it already, I would encourage you to find and watch the origami documentary, [*Between the Folds*](https://www.amazon.com/Between-Folds-Vanessa-Gould/dp/B003DQ6I2C).
