It has been far too long since I added a new post. Life just sort of gets in the way sometimes. But, I was inspired to post again.

Having just completed Andy Weir's _The Martian_, I've been thinking about media, technology and applications of both to educational technology. If you haven't already read Weir's debut novel, a highly enjoyable survival story of an astronaut, Mark Watney, left behind on Mars when his crewmates suddenly are forced to flee the planet, I strongly recommend it. It reads like a longer version of the Apollo 13 mission. Remember the scene in the film adaptation where a guy shows up with a cardboard box of parts that look like an auto mechanic's yard sale and says, "I think we can save them"? _The Martian_ is like that for nearly its entire length.

What does that have to do with educational technology you ask? As a classic survivor tale, the book is about all of the following (yes, there's overlap, but bear with me):

- **Resource Constraints**: Mark Watney is constantly analyzing what he has in terms of resources and how to make the most of those resources. _Most of us working in educational technology often feel constraints on our resources: dollars, equipment, space, time, etc. Like Watney, we’re regularly challenged to make the most of what we have. Of course, while our livelihood depends on it, our lives do not._ 
- **Tools**: when is a hammer not a hammer? When it can be sharpened into a stake. That's not in the book, but our fearless astronaut is always rethinking how to use or repurpose his toolset (see Resource Constraints above). _I recall a story I read many years ago when Microsoft brought Office users in for a focus group and the engineers were flummoxed to discover that users rarely used the tools they, the software engineers, developed in the way they expected the users to do so. Some of the most successful applications of educational technologies occur when people realize that a tool can be used in completely new ways._
- **Optimism**: Throughout Watney's ordeal, he never loses his sense of optimism. He knows his decisions mean life or death, which perhaps helps, but he never completely gives in to the despair that would likely cost him his life and he seems content to "die trying." _Optimism drives us to keep trying new things. Very few of us (I hope) have simply thrown up our hands and said, “Alright, then, keep your chalk and your slate tablets and go back to your lecture”!_
- **Humor**: Hand in hand with the optimism, Watney never loses his sense of humor. Most of the story is told through journal entries. He realizes he may die, but if he does, he wants others to know how he lived (and possibly died). While he doesn't sugarcoat his situation, he also doesn't dehumanize the entries by recording "just the facts, ma'am." _The colleagues I’ve met in the ed-tech field are some of the funniest/craziest/silliest folks I know. I think this goes hand-in-hand with the optimism above._
- **Throwing out what you don't need**: on several occasions, Watney's survivability depends on throwing out what isn't essential to the task at hand. He realizes there is risk in doing so, but sometimes he simply has to focus on the primary goal and everything else is non-essential. _This is probably our biggest challenge, less so, perhaps, for ourselves, but more so in our work with faculty. Convincing faculty to strive for greater student understanding even it it means sacrificing content coverage is a good example._
- **Old technology**: Watney's enough of a voyager to know how to navigate by the stars, even when the stars (and the length of the day) are different when experienced on Mars. Still, at one point he fashions a makeshift sextent to navigate across the Martian landscape. _I’m not advocating that we cling to old technology, but we certainly need to understand what makes/made older technology successful and, where appropriate, make sure we don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Not only that, but sometimes the old technology becomes a great “plan B” lifesaver._
- **New technology**: Of course, he wouldn't be on Mars in the first place if it weren't due to new technologies--nearly all of it designed to save the lives of astronauts. _I’ve often repeated the line that, in higher ed, “nobody ever dies in a computer crash.” Thankfully, that is true for us. Nevertheless, as educational technology professionals, this is (a large part of) our lives. While we are the ones who often introduce new technologies to our campus, we must be equally responsive to new technologies arriving on our campus brought by students, faculty and other staff. We are constantly walking the line between being reactive and proactive. Unlike the tech for our astronaut hero, not all of the technology that comes our way is there to help us._
- **Applied knowledge to new situations**: however, it is Watney's ability to combine knowledge of both old and new technology that improves his chances to survive. _This is the meat and potatoes of our profession--how do we take what we know about teaching and learning and apply new technology to create more successful solutions. We constantly remind ourselves, and our faculty, that it isn’t the technology, but the teaching and learning that counts. For better or worse, though, any campus that doesn’t embrace a certain level of technology is likely to find itself out of business or in an increasingly narrow niche market._ 
- **Perseverance**: Watney never gives up, not just on his mission to survive, but even on his mission as an astronaut, collecting and labeling rock samples during his trans-Martian journey even if he is unable to deliver them back to earth. _I hope that, like our Martian explorer protagonist, you wake up each day with the same desire to push onward with the mission to improve the teaching and learning experience on your campus, leaving enough of a record for others to learn from what you’ve done that has succeeded and what hasn’t._ 
- **Collaboration:** Not to spoil the book, but Watney doesn't just MacGyver a new spaceship and send himself home. Everything leading up to the book's conclusion is a combination of Watney's own efforts and ingenuity, along with what is probably the single most expensive rescue attempt operation the Earth has ever seen. Collaboration will make or break the outcome. _That is certainly true for us. Our positions are essentially defined as collaborative at the outset, and our success depends on multiple collaborations within our institutions._

What about you? Have you read _The Martian_? In what other ways does your job seems like a survivor story? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

_As sort of a postscript, there are two other media-related themes that were harder to connect to our profession, but wanted to add nonetheless:_

- **Fondness for old media**: I think it suffices to say that old media, in particular TV and music from the 1970s, is a recurring theme in “The Martian.” In fact, except for the location and some newer contemporary references, this novel embraces the 1970s in many ways.
- **Media obsession with crisis**: though downplayed in terms of text and page time, it wouldn't be a contemporary tale without mentioning the Earth-based media attention Watney's survival and rescue attempt tale garnishes, with a daily show on CNN to update viewers on the latest events. Even that is reminiscent of the media attention paid to the Iran hostage situation of 1979-81, with nightly updates throughout the 444-day ordeal.
