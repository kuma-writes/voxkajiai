[Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/), an inspiring event that I absolutely need to attend in person at some point, just wrapped up in San Francisco, and I found myself browsing on theeveny website for video reports from the show. There I across the [article](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/05/owen-grace-guitar-zeros.html) on Owen Grace, one of the members of the band [Guitar Zeros](http://theguitarzeros.com/), who use game console instruments along with the [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/ "Cycling 74 homepage") program to make music.

Essentially, they have taken the non-musical instruments for games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band and actually turned them into functioning musical instruments. They employ Max/MSP software and the motion sensing capabilities and the limited buttons on the game controller to synthesize a wide variety of musical sounds.

They have also released code as a freely downloadable, open source project called FRETBUZZ so that others can begin making real music with their game-based instruments. The software and guide is available on their site, [theguitarzeros.com](http://theguitarzeros.com). Another limited time beta project is available, too. It’s called Music Construction Set: The Blues, and is available at [1louderthan10.ea.com](http://1louderthan10.ea.com).

On a side note, what caught my attention early on in the accompanying video was that Owen Grace’s exposure to Max/MSP, the tool that really inspired him to push the limits of what can be done, came while taking classes in the graduate digital music program at Dartmouth College.

In the same way that TEDx conferences are popping up at educational institutions around the world, I wonder what it would take to bring a version of Maker Faire to campus? I’m sure we have the tinkerers around campus and our community to make it interesting. Is that something that is already happening where you are? If so, I’d be very interested to hear about it.

Oh, and be sure to check out the [Make Magazine](http://makezine.com/) website, or magazine at your local bookstore. Great stuff!
