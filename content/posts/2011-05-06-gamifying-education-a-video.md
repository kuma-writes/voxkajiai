Today I wasn’t quite sure what I would write about until I stumbled upon this excellent video on [Gamifying Education](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/extra-credits/3167-Gamifying-Education). Okay, I only partially stumbled upon it. I’m a fan of several of the video segments that appear on The Escapist, but that is beside the point.

Anyway, I really think the video speaks for itself as topics go, but there are two issues that occurred to me while watching it. 1) I really wish we could teach our students to communicate this effectively. This particular video style is becoming more common, with fast cuts and combinations of simple hand drawn illustrations along with carefully, and cleverly, selected photos to communicate the message in memorable ways. 2) I wonder how transferrable the kinds of gamification they describe would be to the college level? I don’t doubt that what they describe is doable, but I think it would take quite a bit more effort to scale the activities to the college student demographic. But, maybe I’m wrong.

There are certainly challenges to and valid criticisms of gamification, and I'm certainly not suggesting it as a panacea for all teaching. However, I’m hoping to share this video with my peers to see what they think, and I’d love to hear your thoughts, too.
