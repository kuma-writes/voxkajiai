*Yield*: 8 scones

__INGREDIENTS__

Scones:
* 2 cups all-purpose flour (9 ounces)
* 2 tablespoon granulated sugar or maple sugar
* 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 5 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
* 7-8 strips bacon, diced, cooked and cooled
* 1/2 cup half and half
* 1 large egg white
* 1/3 cup grade B maple syrup

Glaze: (for a more savory scone, just skip the glaze)
* 3/4 cup powdered sugar
* 3-4 tablespoons maple syrup

__PREPARATION__

1. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Place baking mat on baking tray and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt and whisk it all up. Using a pastry cutter or two knifes, cut in the chilled butter until the butter is equally small and incorporated. Add your diced bacon, mix well.
3. Using a fork, whisk together half and half and egg white in liquid measuring cup. Then add half and half mixture and maple syrup to your flour. Using a fork stir just until everything is incorporated (do not over mix). Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead a few times to form a solid mass. Pat dough into a 6-inch square about 1 1/4 inches thick. Using a floured knife, cut into four 3-inch squares. Cut squares in half on the diagonal to form eight triangles. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake at 425 degrees for 18-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden. Transfer to a wire baking rack to cool. In a small bowl, mix powdered sugar and maple syrup together. Using a pastry brush glaze the scones. The sooner the eaten the better!
