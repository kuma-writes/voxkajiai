__INGREDIENTS__

* 1 package tofu
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1/2 to 1 tablespoon minced ginger (to your liking)
* 4 oz sliced shiitake mushrooms
* 1 cup crab meat
* 1 tablespoon rice wine
* 6 cups chicken soup stock
* 1 teaspoon hon-dashi (Japanese soup stock powder)
* salt to taste
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 tablespoon water
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 tablespoons minced scallion
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro

__PREPARATION__

1. Cut tofu into 1/2 inch cubes and set aside to drain.
2. Sweat minced ginger in a wok with oil.
3. Add shiitake, crab meat, rice wine and soup stock. Bring to a boil.
4. Drain water from tofu and gently add to soup. Season with hon-dashi and salt. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes.
5. Mix water and cornstarch, then add to soup to thicken. [You may want to add more cornstarch paste for a thicker soup.]
6. Slowly pour beaten eggs into soup while stirring to create evenly distributed threads, or "blossoms."
7. Turn off heat and add scallions and cilantro. Serve hot.
