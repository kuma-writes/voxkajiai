This episode is almost all about television! We touch on new seasons for returning shows, such as _[Mad Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/)_ and lament the loss of simple sharing via VHS, raising once again the spectre of DRM's impact, and the fallacy of scarcity in the digital marketplace. Laura discovers _[Community](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439629/)_ and asks, "Is _[The Office](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/)_ too cruel for some tastes"?

In books, it's _[The Information](http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/0375423729)_ by James Gleick, [_Death Comes to Pemberly_](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Comes-Pemberley-P-D-James/dp/0307959856/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333111033&sr=1-1) by P.
