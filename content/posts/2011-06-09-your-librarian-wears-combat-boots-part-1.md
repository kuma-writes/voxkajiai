In my post yesterday, I mentioned that librarians are in the trenches on the front lines in the battles for reasonable and informed copyright law. They are actually fighting on a number of fronts--in the creation of new content, in trying to make existing content available to patrons and researchers, and in preservation of copyrighted materials.

In American history we need look no further to the importance of libraries than to Benjamin Franklin, who, along with his fellow members of the philosophical association, the Junto, created The Library Company in 1731, choosing as their motto “Communiter Bona profundere Deum est,” or roughly, “To support the common good is divine.” And, years later in his autobiography, Franklin wrote:

“these Libraries have improved the general Conversation of Americans, made the common Tradesman and Farmers as intelligent as most Gentlemen from other Countries, and perhaps have contributed in some Degree to the Stand so generally made throughout the Colonies in Defence of their Privileges."

At the founding of the U.S., copyright, too, was seen as a way to promote the progress of knowledge and learning, but by offering creators of works a ”limited“ period in which they could exclusively assert their ownership rights. What the Founding Fathers sought was a way to incentivize works of new knowledge but to avoid having copyright used for ”censorship and monopolistic oppression.“

Libraries and librarians still seek to make materials available for the ”common good.“ They are not, as some industry leaders would imagine, trying to encourage piracy or hasten the death of capitalism and free markets.

One of the fronts on which librarians work is at the site of new knowledge production. Not only are they closely involved with faculty and students in the resource discovery process, but many librarians are active advocates for open publishing.

As more academic journals go digital, but with prices from journal publishers going up, not down, libraries look to the [open access](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm) [initiative](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/acrl.htm) to solve both cost and permission issues. Many are involved with or support digital journals published using the [Open Journal Systems](http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs) (OJS) of the [Public Knowledge Project](http://pkp.sfu.ca/) (PKP), which is designed to assist with ”...every stage of the refereed publishing process, from submissions through to online publication and indexing.” The PKP itself, “... brings together faculty members, librarians, and graduate students dedicated to exploring whether and how new technologies can be used to improve the professional and public value of scholarly research.”

Librarians are also involved in promoting broader academic use rights for faculty who publish. Through our library, we regularly run workshops for faculty on Creative Commons licensing. In these sessions, we not only hope to teach faculty where to find materials they can use safely in their own course materials and research, but we also try to promote the Creative Commons and educate faculty on how to release their own works under the terms of Creative Commons licenses.

Additionally, when faculty are entering into publication contracts, where possible, our institution also tries to help them secure their own future rights to their work, and tries to preserve current and future academic access to their work for the institution.

These are just a few examples related to knowledge production. This is a blog post, after all, not a journal article or book. Next, I’ll touch on efforts by librarians to continue to provide services and access to materials to the anytime-anyplace patron.
