*Comment:* Another quick and easy way to cook dal. I finally had to put this here because I kept Googling for it every time I wanted to make it again.

*Yield:* 2-3 servings

__INGREDIENTS:__  

* 1 cup toovar dal, water to cover 
* Â½ tsp turmeric,
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 2 red chillies
* 1 tsp vegetable oil, like canola
* A generous pinch of asafetida (hing)
* 2 tbsp coconut shreds (optional)
* 10 curry leaves (optional)
* Juice of a lemon
* Salt to taste

__PREPARATION__ 
 
1. Rinse dal, cover with water and add turmeric. Boil until soft (~10 min)
2. Heat the oil, add mustard seeds and asafetida. When the seeds sputter, add the curry leaves and red chillies. Stir fry for a couple of seconds.
3. Add the cooked dal and enough water to get a fairly watery consistency. A dalitoy is typically quite thin, although you could make it thicker if you prefer it.
4. Bring the dal to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer another 10 minutes.
5. Add the coconut shreds and salt to taste.
6. Turn off the heat. Garnish with some fresh coriander, if you like.
