*Yield*: 4 dinner servings, 6 appetizer servings

__INGREDIENTS__

* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 1 small red onion, diced
* 5 cloves of garlic, peeled
* 2 medium gold potatoes, scrubbed, diced
* 1/2 Japanese pumpkin, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks
* 2 large carrots, scrubbed, chopped
* 2 parsnips, peeled, chopped
* 1 fennel bulb, chopped
* 1/2 head chopped cauliflower pieces
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 2 teaspoons dried thyme
* Sea salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste
* 1 quart of organic vegetable broth
* 2 14oz. cans of diced or stewed tomatoes

__PREPARATION__

1. Preheat oven to 400ÂºF.
2. Combine the onion, garlic cloves, potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, parsnips, cauliflower and fennel bulb in a roasting pan and toss with the olive oil, fennel and thyme. Season with sea salt and fresh pepper, to taste.
3. Add about a cup of the broth and roast the vegetables for about 60 minutes, until they are tender. Stir at least once during roasting.
4. When the veggies are roasted, pour the rest of the broth into a soup pot, along with tomatoes and bring to a high simmer.
5. Add the roasted vegetables (including any liquid and all the bits and pieces from the pan). Cover the soup pot and simmer gently for about 10 to 15 minutes.
6. Puree the soup with blender or immersion blender.
7. Stir and taste for seasoning adjustments, and warm through gently. Add more liquid if your soup is thicker than you prefer; if it is too thin, cook a little longer to reduce the liquid.
