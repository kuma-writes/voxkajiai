The focus of yesterday was primarily around getting my blog up and running. I had written the first post already and wrote the second, but knew I needed to get them online. 

I decided that I wanted something simple and straightforward, and came across [PHPetite](https://phpetite.org) by [Bradley Taunt](https://uglyduck.ca) and liked the approach, having already been a fan of [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) and [(RIP)](http://www.aaronsw.com/) Aaron Swartz's  [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for many years. So I started reading through the basic requirements, namely PHP 7.3. On my Mac I did a quick check and saw that I was only running 7.3, so there was work to do.

I fired up [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) and proceeded to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install PHP. Memory should have kicked in to remind me that it is never that easy, not the least of which because the current version of PHP is now v8.0, and PHP 7 will lose support in November 22. Homebrew finished doing its thing, but I still didn't have things where they needed to be. A quick Google search led me to Casey McMullen's article on Medium, ["How to Install Apache on macOS 10.13 High Sierra and 10.14 Mojave using Homebrew."](https://medium.com/@crmcmullen/how-to-install-apache-on-macos-10-13-high-sierra-and-10-14-mojave-using-homebrew-3cb6bf6e3cd4). I followed the instructions in both parts 1 and 2, and almost had things working, but realized that my installation order was backward, which seemed to be affecting things. Once I reinstalled PHP, things were working. Yay!

Back onto PHPetite, I grabbed the repo from Git and tried to run the build script for an out-of-the-box experience. That didn't quite go as expected. Bash was not liking how Emanuil Rusev's [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org) was getting included, and I also realized I had probably not satisfied the requirements for PHP XML and PHP mbstring either, so I decided to give Bradley's source of inspiration a go instead, Gregory Cadars' [portable-php](https://github.com/cadars/portable-php). This worked pretty much OOTB, including the Parsedown calls, which left me some time to get comfortable with the process and do just a little bit of customization to get to where we are now.

Which is where, exactly? Right, here on [Neocities](https://neocities.org)! But, how did I get here? I can't even remember which [Reddit](https://reddit.com) pushed me down this particular rabbit hole, but from Bradley Taunt's page I learned about the [1MB Club](https://1mb.club). There, I found [Zenryeh's](https://zenryeh.com) page. His post, ["On New Tools"](https://zenryeh.com/articles/on-new-tools) is where I learned about Neocities. With tongue firmly in cheek, I decided "why not" and landed here.

For now, I'm editing posts with [Markdown Pro](http://www.markdownpro.com)[^1], saving them within the portable-php folder structure. Then generating the index.html page via the portable-php code. Saving that out to my local drive, and dragging the new index.html file up to my Neocities site. It is a bit convoluted at the moment, but the simplicity of of the output is what I like. It allows me to focus on the writing, too.
