In the past couple of years, several people have been working to bring to the fore the idea that remixing our culture should not be viewed as criminal (as in copyright violation), but is in fact almost core to our cultural development--that ours is a remix culture. You hear it in music all the time. Books, movies, TV shows...they all borrow from the past. The remix is explicit in the works of artists like [DJ SPOOKY](http://www.djspooky.com/) (such as in his [Re-Birth of a Nation](http://www.rebirthofanation.com/) film) and it is a topic that Lawrence Lessig discusses often as well (in books, in public speeches, in magazines, and in his [blog](http://www.lessig.org/blog/), which is now on sabbatical, but worth a read).

The latest example I came upon is the site “[Everything is a Remix](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/)” by Kirby Ferguson, a New York-based filmmaker. Ferguson is planning a four-part video series. The first two episodes have been completed, with a third to follow this summer. He is also using the site to solicit financial support for this project. The site itself, which is an ongoing blog about the project, not only provides the videos, but also samples, references, links to information about all the tools he’s using in the production of the work.

In the latest blog posting, Ferguson announces that he is opening up the production to outside contributors. “Whatever you do – videography, photography, motion, graphic design, illustration, research, whatever – could find its way into the next installment.” ([Contribute to Everything is a Remix Part 3](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/contribute-to-everything-is-a-remix-part-3/)). The blog also contains links to other remix works, links to source materials, links to the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Flattr, and GoodieBag.tv) and more. It’s like viewing the DVD extra before the film is even complete.

Projects such as these represent a new take on an old form. There’s not really much here that stands out as particularly different from what documentary filmmakers have been doing for years to get their films made. It is, however, a great example of using new media outlets and skills throughout the production process.

I strongly recommend that you take a look and check back in as the final parts eventually get released.
