I don’t know what’s happening at your campus, but we have been discussing our desires for a unified media content management system for several years now. The problem, not unlike the three blind men describing the elephant, is that all of the interested parties have specific requirements or needs that are unique to their divisions. So, what happens is that we become mired in defining the feature set, and progress stalls. I’ve been asking for some time now, is it possible to have one media content system that does what we all want it to do?

In short, here are some of the key desired features:

- it needs both public and private options per media object.
- it needs to have course limited access to certain content
- it needs to have role-based publishing (faculty can post for students, students can post for courses, groups can publish for groups)
- it needs to be able to ingest some materials in a quasi-automatic way, such as for classroom lecture capture
- it needs to have a way of permitting time-defined playback (playing back only 30 sec. of a 2 min. clip, for example) OR
- it needs to allow for users to excerpt, edit or mashup
- it needs to have time-delimited playback (available from, available until), set by the user
- it needs to have generally universal playback (Mac, Windows, Linux, plus mobile)
- it needs to allow for rich metadata for long-term data storage and retrieval purposes
- within the metadata, it should accommodate rights management information
- it needs to integrate with our identity management system
- it needs to integrate with our learning management system
- Oh, and of course it should be easy-to-use.

So, could there possibly be one platform that does all that? Or should we be looking at multiple products?

So, what is happening on your campus? What are the defined needs for you?
