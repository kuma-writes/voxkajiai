In the latest episode of the MediaMixED Podcast, with Laura back on board, Josh opened the floor by describing the change taking place in his division as it moves now into an open office plan, with stand-up desks and no walls. How do open designs impact the way we work, and when and how do we still carve out some privacy?

In books, Laura is on to Arthur Phillips' latest, _The Tragedy of Arthur: A Novel_, Josh is back in non-fiction territory with David Weinberger'sÂ _To Big To Know: Rethinking Knowledge Now That the Facts Aren't the Facts, Experts Are Everywhere, and the Smartest Person in the Room Is the Room_, and Anthony is still on George R. R. Martin.

In television it's _The Boss, Justified, Lilyhammer, American Horror Story, Touch_, and the still enjoyable _Firefly_.
