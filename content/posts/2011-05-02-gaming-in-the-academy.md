In our media center you’ll find VHS tapes, DVDs, CDs, audio, microfiche and the hardware needed to access these resources, which support the academic inquiry that takes place among our students and faculty across a wide breadth of campus disciplines. On our library shelves you’ll find a growing collection of manga, comic books, and graphic novels also supporting a diverse, though smaller, group of faculty and students. What you won’t find in our library or media center are video games, which are also being studied more and more by students and faculty on our campus in a number of disciplines--media studies, English, music, women and gender studies, and computer science to name a few.

According to an NPD study in 2007, 72% of American reported playing video games, up from 64% in 2006 ([http://www.military.com/entertainment/games/game-news/70-percent-of-americans-play-video-games](http://www.military.com/entertainment/games/game-news/70-percent-of-americans-play-video-games)). In 2010, twenty percent, or some 56.8 million American reported playing video games on a social network, such as Facebook. ([http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press\_100823.html](http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_100823.html)). If nearly three-quarters of our population is engaged in playing video games, it only makes sense that, as an academic institution, we begin to commit resources to support further academic study of this activity, doesn’t it?

I’d like to see us collect games the way we collect DVDs. We should pick up a couple of game systems as well but, of course, we’ll need to rethink our spaces in order to provide a suitable playing environment, so that game players don’t swing a controller into the person sitting in another booth trying to watch a DVD. We’ll probably have to rethink our loan policy, too. While a movie can be polished off in 2 hours, a video game can take 10-20 hours or more to finish.

Of course, there are other issues to consider:

- Consoles and games on disc are great for now, but can we depend on them to be accessible in 5, 10, 20 years? Will they still be playable?
- Digital distribution is really taking off, from companies like Steam, Direct2Disc, and others for PC games, and of course there are digital downloads available for Microsoft’s XBOX 360, the Sony Playstation 3, and Nintendo’s DS and Wii consoles. How will we catalog a digital game that downloads and installs on library owned systems, as opposed to a physical disc? We can already catalog digital documents, but games are a trickier business.
- Speaking of digital distribution, I really like the approach taken by Good Old Games, [gog.com](http://gog.com). They take older games, make sure all the updates and patches are applied, and then make sure the games will run on Windows XP and Windows 7 PCs. When the games are purchased, you can download and install them at your leisure. Even better, they are released with none of the DRM (digital rights management) code that so often hobbles older games when the parent company no longer supports it. The games can be archived to your own disc and reinstalled at any time. That’s a model that I think would work well in the library.
- With so much e-commerce finding its way into the games themselves, I anticipate some problems or issues with making library “accounts” available for free-play usage in the LIbrary. I’m thinking that “parental controls” will need to be put in place.
- For academic inquiry, I’d really like to see game studios either begin to publish or allow others to publish scripts to their more narrative properties. I don’t mean novelizations, or walkthrough guides, but actual game scripts. That is a rich resource waiting to be plumbed.
- While I’m dreaming, an auto-play feature would be nice, too. But with the open world experiences found on many games, I don’t see that as realistic.

I’m sure that I am missing other considerations. What’s happening on your campus?

I expect to revisit this topic again in the future, and will likely write about other aspects of gaming in the academy as part of this blog. I look forward to hearing your feedback.
