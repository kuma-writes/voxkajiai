First of all, let me say that I'm glad to be back with another post. Now, on to it...

This is the time of year that my DVR gets its biggest workout--the new Fall TV season. Not only am I eager to catch the return of favorite shows, but I am also on the lookout for a new show that is worth my time week to week. Like a Pokémon trainer, I feel like “gotta catch ‘em all.” And, indeed, I do try to catch many of the new shows.

Although I feel pressed to watch all the new shows in a given window, I really don’t need to catch them all with my DVR, do I? Apparently, I’m not alone. According to a story on NPR’s _All Things Considered_ yesterday, a recent survey of likely voters found that [“31 percent of voters…had not watched live TV in the past week.”](http://www.npr.org/2011/09/26/140813332/political-ads-target-tv-but-not-everyone-is-tuning-in) That doesn’t mean that they didn’t watch TV, only that they did not watch a TV program when it was broadcast.

So many options exist today. There are millions of Tivo owners and most cable companies offer DVR capabilities, too. Outlets such as Hulu and other online services, including the networks themselves, offer the programming “on demand.”

What’s more, the real irony is that my behavior is more of a “catch and release” model. That is, I may record a number of shows, but will end up deleting them without even watching? Why? There are simply too many other options for my attention. (See the first post of this blog--[What's your Media Montage?)](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/whats-your-media-montage/ "What’s your Media Montage?")

So, while there’s still a bit of TV-Guide Tetris to play with my and my DVR’s schedule, I accept the fact that I just might not see all the new shows I hope to see. And that’s ok. After all, what I miss on TV today, will probably be in our library DVD rack by next Spring, especially if it’s “The Complete Series” on a single disc.
