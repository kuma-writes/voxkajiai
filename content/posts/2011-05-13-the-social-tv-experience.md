I am very glad to see that [TVGuide.com](http://TVGuide.com) had taken up researching viewer habits beyond simple Nielsen ratings. Specifically, TVGuide.com’s general manager and executive vice president of TV Guide Digital, Christy Tanner, will present at the [Mashable Connect](http://mashable.com/connect/) event today on how “social” television programs are, based on [TVGuide.com](http://TVGuide.com) checkin, Facebook likes, and site comments.

Some of the information released so far on the [Mashable site](http://mashable.com/2011/05/13/most-social-tv-shows/) points out that, while shows like NCIS and American Idol are both big ratings earners, programs like Glee and Smallville are among the top 10 “social shows” despite lower ratings. Twitter appears to be the primary tool for engagement, with 50% of users tweeting while watching. [TVGuide.com](http://TVGuide.com) also has gathered information on how people are using device-specific apps to interact with television shows. A quick check of the iTunes App Store shows that the [Glee Karaoke](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glee-karaoke/id360736774?mt=8) app is still one of the Top 150 bestselling apps and is one of the Top 10 highest grossing music apps.

I am not alone in believing for years that Nielsen ratings by themselves are poor indications of program popularity. Not only that, but viewership is only one data point offering feedback to the program’s producers. I’ve participated in surveys and focus groups for television programming in the past. I remember one survey in particular from the early days of NBC’s “The Office” that asked for my opinions on all of the characters, how I felt about the relationship between Pam and Jim, and whether I wanted some characters to be featured more often than others. Now, from a simple Twitter search, researchers can gauge audience feedback coast-to-coast in real-time and determine what’s working and what isn’t. During last Fall’s rollout of new shows, television critics were quick to gauge the potential success of a new show based on how much buzz it was receiving in social networks.

None of this is particularly new to me. I recall during the 2008 Presidential Candidate Debates using my television and my computer, with multiple windows open, to track the Twitterverse chatter, online streams from several news outlets along with their accompanying live-pulse data, and sites that were doing real-time fact-checking of the candidates’ answers. It was overload, but at the same time I marveled at the situation, too.

Every conference I attend now has an active “back channel” during presentations, and these are often as informative or more so than the presenter. They also provide a “record” of the event that is richer than my notes have often been. Schools and faculty are using instant-feedback devices to gauge student engagement and responses to lectures, especially in large classes. I don’t expect faculty contracts to be “cancelled” like TV shows, but I do believe that the back channel can provide useful information, especially if intentionally tapped into during the class or addressed afterward in online discussions or future class sessions. Yes, there is always fluff and other noise, but in 140 characters or less, it can actually be filtered through quite easily.

After years of hearing doom-and-gloom predictions about how the computers and the Internet would lead to less and less human interaction, I think we are more engaged than ever. At least, many of us are.

How about you? Do you participate in the back channel during conferences or during your favorite TV show? Let me know in the comments.
