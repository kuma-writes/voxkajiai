I decided to scratch my niche, so to speak. Think of it describing a TV show, person or site that you like that you think not enough people know about. I’m calling the series “Long-Tail Heroes” because that seems like the best way to describe them. They’ve earned my respect for their willingness to play to the small audience out of a love for what they do. I’m sure that some of them would be more than happy to move further up the tail, but they seem primarily interested in doing what they do just because they want to do it.

In the troll-filled world of the Internet, it takes guts to put yourself out there, but the ones I'll write about are not the one-hit wonders with silly home videos. These are the ones who are much smarter than that, the ones who craft their message, or persona, or who demonstrate a particular skill in using the new media tools and outlets available to them. While this may not seem particularly academic on the face of it, I think that these are skills that many of our students should learn to develop, not only for themselves, but potentially for the companies and/or institutions that they will eventually lead.

For this, they are my modern day heroes of the Internet.

On to episode #1:

A couple of days ago, a friend embedded a YouTube video on FaceBook that I felt compelled to share back out. The video (above) was of a red-haired, teenage girl with braces rockin’ a cover of OutKast’s “Hey Ya” on her ukulele. I watched it a couple of more times, impressed by her performance, her naturalness and her spirit. I decided to switch over to YouTube to see what else she may have posted and was surprised to see not just a handful of videos, but [forty](http://www.youtube.com/user/MusicMaaad)! She’s 16 from Dublin, Ireland, and has only been on YouTube since 2009. Her videos are a combination of guitar and ukulele performances for the most part, and she really is quite talented.

What impressed me even more, though, was seeing how she is starting to develop her social marketing skills, which paid off recently when she caught the attention of Michael Buckley, YouTube personality and host of his own “[What the Buck Show](http://www.youtube.com/user/WHATTHEBUCKSHOW).” Getting a mention from Buck lifted her subscriber numbers to over 20,000. According to one of her latest videos, getting noticed was partly an effort by a friend of hers, BriBry, who is also a musician but whose YouTube channel is primarily devoted to videotaping his list of “[things to do before you die](http://www.youtube.com/user/BriBryontour).“

Orla Gartland’s video has links out to BriBry’s music on iTunes, The Buck Factor episode that featured her, as well as links to her Twitter feed (with over 1100 followers) and Facebook fan page (with over 10,000 ”likes“). She also maintains a Blogger site, though clearly she is compartmentalizing her broadcasts over her various social media channels. I find that kind of social intelligence quite amazing, but for her, I’m guessing, it is all quite natural.

I'm now subscribing to her YouTube channel as well, and wish her continued success.
