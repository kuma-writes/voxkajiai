Yesterday was a bit of a break, combining some technology and non-technology activities. Although, I suppose lighting is technology, as are books, but I digress. 

There is a closet here in my office room that has AC power, but no installed lighting. Years ago, I purchased a set of [Dioder](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/dioder-led-4-piece-light-strip-set-white-20119418/) LED lights from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/) and used those to illuminate the space, but always in a very lazy way, draping the lights and cords hither and yon. It was finally time to address that. So, I used the supplied mounting brackets and installed the lights as they should have been installed long before now. What a change it made to the overall visibility of the space!

As I am no longer employed in higher ed and do not have ready access to the library and online resources that afforded me, it was time to remedy that also by finally getting a library card for my local library. The library is only a couple of minutes' walk from my home and I had confirmed earlier that it would be open given reductions in hours under COVID hours. The library itself is small, a single room in an older schoolhouse building that also houses an auditorium that, presumably, served as a gymnasium in its past. Despite the size, the few shelves contained quite a good selection of contemporary books and DVDs (!). The staff member was courteous and quickly processed my card application, while telling me of the various services now available to me with card in hand, including access to [Overdrive](https://overdrive.com) for ebooks and audiobooks, [Kanopy](https://kanopy.com/) for streaming films and tv, [Mango Languages](https://mangolanguages.com) for language learning, [Universal Class](https://www.universalclass.com) for online classes, [Wowbrary](https://wowbrary.org) for notification of new acquisitions, and [Gale Infotrac](https://link.gale.com/apps/menu) databases. Armed with my new card, I proceeded to borrow Isabel Wilkerson's [Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/51152447-caste), Leigh Bardugo's YA fantasy heist [Six of Crows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows), and the graphic novel [Habibi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10138607-habibi), by Craig Thompson, and headed back home.

Between the IKEA lighting and the library, I did work for a bit on technology-related items. After years of sitting folded up quietly on a shelf, I decided to dust off my son's old [Epson Stylus Photo R280](https://epson.com/For-Home/Printers/Photo/Epson-Stylus-Photo-R280-Ink-Jet-Printer/p/C11C691201) printer. I expected most of the ink to be dry, but that turned out not to be the case. Every single tank was, however, just about empty. I cleaned the outside, connected it to my iMac, and installed the latest drivers. Powering it up, the printer instantly and unsurprisingly flashed its ink light at me. I pressed the button and was informed that yellow ink needed replacing. Thankfully, I had a spare box of cartridges and went to work. After loading the yellow tank, I opened the printer utility and clicked on the clean print heads button. After the usual whirring, the printer now informed me that all of the remaining color tanks needed replacing. That completed, I ran the print test page job and found lots of streaking, so I ran a combination of the clean print heads and test print jobs a few more times and things improved, though black continued to streak. I found an ink test print online and printed it out, confirming the black streaking but a few other issues as well. I went ahead and replaced the black tank, which improved things, but a few streaks remained even still. Turning to the internet for advice, as one does, I followed the direction to use a bit of alcohol on cotton swaps to clean the nozzles, and that seems to have done the trick. My plan is to identify some photos on my computer that are worth printing, pull out the box of fancy printer paper, and see what I can produce worth framing.

The other technology trip down memory lane landed me in retro gaming territory. I came across a note online about uses for an older tablet. I have an [Amazon Fire HD 8](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X) going to waste, so reading the article it suggested using it in the kitchen for recipes or for retro gaming. Cool! Let's do both. So I proceeded to locate my collection of ripped ROMs from my own physical cartridges and read up a bit on [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com), the fronted tool for emulation. I plan to work on getting that setup today.
