*Yield*: 6-8 dinner servings

__INGREDIENTS__

* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 2 ribs celery, diced
* 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 1/3 cup Trader Joe’s Harvest Grains Blend
* 2 1/2 teaspoons McCormick Cajun seasoning
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 3/4 cup water
* 1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 2 links (~1 pound) of Andouille sausage, sliced into half-moons
* 3 plum tomatoes, seeded and diced
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

__PREPARATION__

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook for 10 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook an additional minute.
4. Add Harvest Grains blend and 2 tsp of the Cajun seasoning, stir and cook for a minute.
5. Add broth and water, stir, bring to a boil and cook on high for 2 minutes.
6. Remove from heat and pour into a 2 quart baking dish. (I used a square pyrex dish, which accounts for a cooking change later, step 10).
7. Cover baking dish with foil and cook for 25 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine shrimp, sausage, tomatoes, parsley, and remaining 1/2 tsp of Cajun seasoning.
9. Remove baking dish from oven, uncover, and spoon shrimp and sausage mix on top. (This will fill the square dish). Recover with foil and bake an additional 20 minutes.
10. After 20 minutes raise temperature to 400ºF and bake an additional 15 minutes. (Perhaps due to my oven or my dish size, the shrimp were not fully cooked, so I added this extra cooking time)
11. Remove from oven, uncover and serve.
