Before leaving my recent position in higher ed, I needed to return my laptop and iPad, so I took advantage of the educational discount and purchased a new [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad/). It did take me several days to decide on a model though, as I weighed the pros and cons of each of the options. 

[iPad Mini](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/), [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/), [iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/), [11" iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/), [12.9" iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/)

Not knowing how long it might be until I was employed again with a company-provided laptop, I decided that I wanted something that would last a while and serve in a pinch as a laptop replacement[^1], so that ruled out the iPad Mini. 

~~iPad Mini~~, *iPad, iPad Air, 11" iPad Pro, 12.9" iPad Pro*

I ruled out the iPad Pro as being too large, but also too close in price to a new laptop.

The 2020 iPad had not really seen much of an update for a while. Notably, the front camera was still just 1.2MP, video recording remained at 1080p, and the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi were on earlier standards. Pricewise it was good, but the model felt somewhat end-of-life.[^2]

Finally, down to the last two models. The iPad Air and 11" iPad Pro are nearly identical in just about every detail. I don't even understand how the "Air" designation matters. They are the same size and nearly the same weight. Perhaps the extra cameras contribute to the 8g weight difference for the Pro, but the Pro even manages to have a slightly thinner depth. Beyond the additional cameras, the Pro camera array has TrueDepth technology, higher framerate, and Lidar capabilities, and the iPad includes a quad speaker set and the newer Apple M1 chip. For me, also, it had the right amount of memory/storage that I wanted, 128GB.

So, in the end, that was my compromise. I could get 256GB for about $50 cheaper, but I feel the tech specs of the iPad Pro were worth the storage trade-off for my needs.

I have to say, I'm quite pleased so far. As I usually do, I also ordered a new [glass screen protector](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08ZHLT5HJ/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_AV2BZEC054A94JMCV6DN?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1), a [case](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08VRQPG4H/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_VFZVXGDWB38JYETR0S5Y?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1), and a [knock-off](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B098GVM6GG/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_254GQN0WM8K70T8X6SP4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) of the Apple Pencil 2. Those pieces arrived this week, so I'll be getting more familiar with it all in the days ahead, and I am looking forward to the iPadOS 15 release on September 20.

FWIW, I also have a portable [Logitech K480 Bluetooth keyboard](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00MUTWLW4/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_QPWG6SXYA17Q260CF1HY) and the iPad Pro fits comfortably in the slot even with the new case on it.

[^1]: Why not just get a laptop? I'm fairly particular about specs for one thing, and that would push up the price beyond my budget, but also I do have some older laptops around that can serve the laptop needs in the interim.
[^2]: While not end-of-life as a model, it was replaced with the newer 2021 model following Apple's event on September 14.
