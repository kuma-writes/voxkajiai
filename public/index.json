Quite simply, I enjoyed the experience. The film, like most in Villeneuve\u0026rsquo;s oevre is nearly the opposite of a typical Hollywood blockbuster. Much like Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, it is quiet and stark, which seems surprising for a film of this era. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, there are battle scenes and other action set pieces, but they are not the sensory overload that seems to be so commonplace in a world of Marvel and DC action films. I also recently saw the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, and even it\u0026rsquo;s action scenes seemed louder and more frenetic, until the final third of the film.\nDune provides me with what I asked for earlier in the blog, time to linger. There is so much to enjoy and to simply take in. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is beautiful. The costumes by Jacqueline West are both sumptuous and restrained, relatively speaking. They feel contemporary and functional where needed, and over-the-top where not (the imperial bubble heads are clearly less about function than form). The sets and/or locations are refined, simple, and uncluttered. Not since Han Solo failed to jump to hyperspace in the Millennium Falcon have I felt the future tech so thoroughly mechanical and believable. And, more importantly, we, the audience, are given time to take it all in without sacrificing the pacing of the story (though I was caught by surprise when I realized this is merely part 1 of the film adaptation).\nFor nostalgic reasons, I thought I might revisit the 1984 David Lynch version of Dune as well. After 20 minutes, though, I have to say I think I\u0026rsquo;m done with it. It is so painful to watch by comparison, and I can\u0026rsquo;t blame it on 1984-era filmmaking. George Lucas\u0026rsquo; Star Wars released in 1977 was already doing science fiction films better. What bothered me in just 20 minutes of watching? The exposition, the bad acting, the feeling of being on a soundstage, the actors thinking they are doing a stage play, and the spacing guild muppets with genitalia for faces who poop out planetary destinations. What the actual\u0026hellip;?! I\u0026rsquo;m glad that Twin Peaks allowed Kyle MacLachlan to find a role that suited him. I cannot believe that both he and Timothée Chalamet were the same age when they each played the role of Paul Atreides. Chalamet\u0026rsquo;s Paul feels much more genuine and less smug, which I did not expect. I realize that Lynch\u0026rsquo;s film is a product of its time and it, too, has some great sets and costumes. They just feel more like sets and costumes. Weirdly, perhaps, one of the things I like about the 1984 version is Kenneth McMillan\u0026rsquo;s Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. I mean, it is an over-the-top performance, but he seems to be one of the few people who understands they are making a movie. His Baron is disgustingly, insanely evil while Stellan Skarsgård\u0026rsquo;s 2021 superb turn as Baron is menacingly evil. Both performances conjure up different path\u0026rsquo;s to their character\u0026rsquo;s respective political ascensions. Neither character is one with whom you want to find yourself alone in a room.\nI also appreciate that there is a greater cultural awareness playing out in the 2021 film version. Dialogue coaches obviously paid more attention to word origins to give more authentic pronunciations of words like \u0026ldquo;Harkonnen\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Padishah\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Shai-Hulud.\u0026rdquo; And, while some characters are gender-swapped, there is more realism in the diversity of casting. Dr. Yueh is more appropriately Asian, the Fremen are a range of ethnicities, and the cast overall is less lily-white than the 1984 film. The new cast, not just Timothée Chalamet, turn in very solid performances (though Jason Momoa has to walk that very thin line between being someone other than Jason Momoa). Only Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban Harkonnen seems to be chewing up the scenery. I can only speculate that he sees his Rabban as the product of too much inbreeding.\nOne of the things that kept my nostalgia for the 1984 film alive for as long as it has is the soundtrack by TOTO. I owned (and still have) a cassette tape of the soundtrack and I played it frequently. I was very into electronic music in 1984 and the Dune soundtrack just slotted in quite nicely among my tapes of Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre. I doubt that I will be listening to the 2021 soundtrack in 35 years, but I do want to acknowledge that Hans Zimmer\u0026rsquo;s work fits the movie very well.\nNow, I only wish the 2021 movie poster didn\u0026rsquo;t look so much like a poster for Rogue One. Frankly, the whole pyramid of people layout is getting really tiresome.\nBlog 26/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"26 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-26/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"In the Dunes","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cooking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cooking","type":"tags"},{"content":"Cooking is one of my escapes. It is one of my meditations. It is one of my favorite creative endeavors. And, it is one of the things I can do that I know I can share with others. That is, I don\u0026rsquo;t really share the cooking process, but I like to be able to share what I produce with others.\nI enjoy that it both has rules and at the same time has no rules. Recipes connect you to someone else\u0026rsquo;s experience, but they do not require or expect that you will have the exact same experience. They are like sketches to treasure maps, showing you the way, but also showing you where X is on the map in case you\u0026rsquo;d like to take a different path. The path to the treasure is almost certainly going to be an adventure, even more so if you decided to take your own detours. You may fail or you may succeed, but the experience is uniquely yours regardless. Anyone who cooks, or enjoys cooking, can tell you that there is as much if not more pleasure to be derived from the process as there is from the product. I can spend hours preparing a meal that is consumed in 10-15 minutes, but I would not trade those hours during which nothing else needed to matter.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what I mean when I say that cooking is a meditation and an escape for me. I often find that during times of stress, especially when there is something that I need to do, I will often seek solace not in food, but in making or preparing food. When I decide to cook, it demands my attention. When chopping vegetables, the knife requires that I be present lest I invountarily decide to contribute even more of myself to the meal. When baking bread, I need to think carefully about measuring the ingredients. There are exceptions, of course, but some recipes do require more precision than others. My mind can take side journeys, but usually only while I am waiting for something to come to a boil or during a long, slow simmer. But that\u0026rsquo;s often when the meditations begin. As I peer into the pot or the mixing bowl, the aromas are carried upward. I think about how the fragrances are coming together. Or maybe I\u0026rsquo;m momentarily transported back to a childhood memory. Or maybe I think about the alchemy that will take place in the oven when the butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and chocolate chips combine. Or maybe I watch in amazement as the dough goes from powder to crumble to sticky mass to smooth, shiny ball of dough. Or how sugar in a pan over a flame transmogrifies from fine white granules to transparent liquid to golden syrup and then to a rich amber elixir. No wonder the witches of fairytales are almost always involved in cooking! There is certainly magic there in those brews!\nCooking is an act of creation as well. Mixing things together to create something entirely new, or that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the same form just a short time prior. We often talk about how we would visit my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s home when we were younger. You could open the refrigerator or pantry, find them sparsely stocked, and think to yourself, \u0026ldquo;I hope she\u0026rsquo;s eating enough.\u0026rdquo; But then find yourself eating a multi-course meal an hour later. We would call these the \u0026ldquo;magic meals.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m glad to know that, while I don\u0026rsquo;t think of it as genetic, I inherited the ability to put together a meal from the most meager of ingredients. I sometimes surprise myself in this regard. Of course, sometimes you may need to call for takeout when things don\u0026rsquo;t quite go together the way you may have imagined they would. But, again, that\u0026rsquo;s part of the adventure.\nThere are times I\u0026rsquo;ve considered whether or not to pursue culinary training. I think I would enjoy the learning, but I\u0026rsquo;m just not certain that I would enjoy cooking as much if it were my full-time job, especially if I were working for someone else. I think I know intuitively that making the leap from apprentice to chef takes years. I know that\u0026rsquo;s one reason why I never want to work in a fast food restaurant either. I would simply be bored making the same food all the time. Even at home, I need to constantly add new items to the menu.\nWhile there are standby and go-to meals, the reason I\u0026rsquo;m the primary cook is simply that my palate demands it. I\u0026rsquo;m really happy that a number of my menu items have evolved over time to be reliably predictable, but I always need something new to try. In that regard, at least, my cooking is at least as consistent as the rest of my life. Some things need to be reliably predictable, and other need to constantly provide something new.\nBlog 25/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"25 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-25/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Cooking: meditation and creation","type":"posts"},{"content":"An idea came to me while out walking yesterday that I thought could evolve into a blog entry, or two, or more. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet. But at its core is the idea that, for whatever reason I am wired the way that I am, and despite the violence in the world, I have not reached a point, nor do I ever hope to reach the point, at which I will not choose love over violence.\nI know that is a complicated statement and a lot to unpack, so let me start by saying that this is not some kind of pollyanna statement, nor is it meant to be some kind of cliché either. It is also not meant as a statement of my always being a good person or of never have malicious thoughts. At the same time, I also fully recognize that it is a statement of privilege, too.\nWe are humans. Biologically, or ecologically, speaking, we are apex predators, the top of the food chain. It is a reality of who we are as animals on this planet. Violence is a part of our nature to survive. We kill to eat, and eat to live. Our societies evolved over the millennia through violence. As a species, not only have we inflicted violence on other creatures, but on other humans as well. And, as biological creatures, sometimes our DNA has errors or anomalies that lead to an increased propensity toward violence. If I am more generous, I could say that for some people it isn\u0026rsquo;t that they have biological \u0026ldquo;errors\u0026rdquo; but rather a stronger threat response system. Perhaps they become those of the warrior class voluntarily. Regardless, violence surrounds us and permeates who we are.\nAt the societal level, we have evolved to become far less violent than we have ever been before on a global scale, even if atrocities still occur. We owe much of the decline of violence to the stability that is provided by meeting the basic needs of a majority of the global population. Simply lifting people out of abject poverty and privation has contributed significantly toward a more peaceful world, along with education and advances in science and medicine.\nStill, there are other forms of violence that reach us. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that I know anyone whose family has not been touched by some kind of violence. In my family, I\u0026rsquo;ve had one former sister-in-law who was murdered by her boyfriend and another sister-in-law who took her own life while suffering from depression. I grew up hearing the stories of the domestic abuse suffered by one of my grandmothers. I know there was relationship violence in the marriage of my parents, and I learned early that I did not want to be nearby when the ticking time-bomb that was my step-father with a six-pack of beers in him unbuckled his belt. For the most part, I escaped many of the potential whippings, but I know my elder siblings had had their own painful experiences of his anger. [I\u0026rsquo;ve heard and read of the experiences of other friends and acquaintances, however, to know that the level of abuse in our home was far, far less severe, and would probably register as typical for the era and our social class.] I also know that violence does not need to be physical either, and that emotional violence can be just as painful, extreme, and cause lasting damage. My point is simply that violence is omnipresent in human lives.\nNevertheless, I choose to embrace love or goodness or whatever is found on the opposite scale of violence. While I do think it is a decision that can be made by anyone anywhere, I also understand that it is much, much harder to do when violence and anguish and hardship and suffering stand always at the ready to destroy every ounce of the love and goodness one may be cultivating. It is easier for me, I know, because I am a middle-aged, white male in a first-world country. No matter what humble existence I was born into, I did not have 200-400 years of oppression to hold me back. I did not have the color of my skin being used against me on a daily basis. The threat of violence does not hover over me, ready to steal my liberty, if not my life, when I see flashing lights in my rearview mirror. Nor was I born in a part of the world still beset by pervasive adversity. Nor was I born as a woman, who must be ever-vigilant against sexual violence even in what should be the safest of environments. So, yes, my privilege makes it easier to choose.\nI choose love and goodness because I believe they are the path away from violent extremes. They are the basis of efforts to educate the world, to heal the world, to lift the world out of poverty and privation. They are the keys to fostering healthier interpersonal relationship.\nAnd, while friendships may be forged in the fires of violence, it is not the sword that makes the fire stronger, nor is it only weapons that the forge produces.\nBlog 24/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"14 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-14/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Choosing love in a violent world","type":"posts"},{"content":"Crabapples hang not\nknowing they are the apples\nof my evening eye\n","date":"13 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-13-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2021-10-13","type":"posts"},{"content":"The morning fog lifts\nRevealing the girl in the\nRed puffy jacket\n","date":"12 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-12-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2021-10-12","type":"posts"},{"content":"For many years, I have been affiliated with a few survey sites where, in return for my time to complete surveys, I receive some kind of benefit, usually some trivial amount of money or points that can later be redeemed for gift cards and the like. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are better ways that I can spend 15 minutes of my time, but there are worse ways, too. And, it does often provide me with a bit of pleasure to provide my opinions from time to time.\nOne of the survey sites will remind me by email when my account is at risk of closure due to inactivity, which usually prompts me to login and complete a survey or two, which I did today.\nWhat surprised me, however, was that one of today\u0026rsquo;s surveys was so horribly slanted for the client that it caught me by surprise. I\u0026rsquo;m very aware of how often \u0026ldquo;push polling\u0026rdquo; is used around political issues, but I just was not expecting this particular survey to be so clearly designed for certain specific outcomes. I wish I had done some screen captures so I could get the text of some of the questions specifically, but I was quite far into the survey before my hackles were particular raised.\nThe survey was clearly being conducted on behalf of internet service providers, either directly or through a lobbying group or association. There were a number of questions about my perceived attitudes towards various providers. Were they innovative? Do I have a positive opinion of this company or that company? How satisfied am I with price, performance, security, reliability? Things like that.\nOne question I should probably explain my response a bit. On the issue of, \u0026ldquo;Do I think that [company xyz] could be trusted with my information\u0026rdquo; my answer is almost always \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve been in IT for too long to know that nothing is ever truly secure. Do I think there are best efforts? Certainly. But, I also know that it was not so very long ago that several telecoms and internet companies were discovered to be actively sharing customer information with the government or at least enabling the NSA to tap major communication systems.\nAnyway, all of these questions were really just softening me, the survey-taker, up for what seems clearly to have been the meat of the survey. Specifically, what were my feelings about net neutrality and municipal broadband? But here\u0026rsquo;s where the questions were slanted in such a way that I could clearly see the survey results coming out of a paid politician\u0026rsquo;s mouth in the months ahead.\nDo I think that internet users who use more should be charged more for their consumption? This is a softball lead in question. Whenever anyone thinks that someone else is getting more than they are for the same price, even for \u0026ldquo;free,\u0026rdquo; it brings out certain pettiness. In the case of the internet, though, especially if we were to think of broadband as a utility service, maybe that does make sense. You pay more for water or electricity if you consume more, after all, don\u0026rsquo;t you? But I know from experience that there is also a minimum amount that I pay regardless. Most of the time, in my house we barely exceed the minimum in our water consumption. What is not established in the survey, though, is anything resembling numbers upon which to base the costs. How much should we expect as \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; as the world slides towards online everything? How much is \u0026ldquo;excessive\u0026rdquo; when movies, music, connected devices, education, and work are expected to transpire over our broadband connection? Cable companies have been sending analog and digital television signals over copper wires for decades without discussing \u0026ldquo;consumption charges,\u0026rdquo; so how is monetizing for individual bits new, other than as a \u0026ldquo;because we can\u0026rdquo; opportunity?\nDo I think that streaming services should pay broadband companies more for all the content they stream to customers? This is the follow-up question, but note how it is framed as asking businesses to pay more. It\u0026rsquo;s the same argument, really, though. What broadband companies want, however, is to be paid twice for the same zero or one. They want the streaming companies to pay to send the bit, and the consumers to pay to receive the same bit. Moreover, we know they want streaming companies to pay a higher rate for the privilege of sending the bits. What is also being ignored in this question is the very real situation of broadband companies becoming owners of the content as well, in which case they then are paid at least three times for the bits: for the sending and receiving of the bits, and for the licensing rights to stream the bits. There\u0026rsquo;s probably a fourth payment in there also for the privilege of being included in the broadband company\u0026rsquo;s streaming device menu, you can be sure. Of course, these costs all just get passed along to the consumer in one form or another regardless.\nDo I think that broadband internet is a right? This one got to me as well. Do I think of it as some inalienable right? Maybe not, exactly. But, as the pandemic has rightly demonstrated, the internet in 2021 is not just about shopping, streaming, and watching TikTok. It has become absolutely critical to our domestic infrastructure to support education, government, and industry. We learned just how unequal opportunity is distributed in this country, and the telecommunications and internet providers are 100% complicit in this. We know that they have collected mandatory fees from customers for decades that were meant to build out infrastructure in rural parts of the country and they have done as little as possible, often pocketing the mandatory fees to add to their own bottom line instead of helping consumers. This question, then, was a lead-in to the next many questions concerning municipal broadband.\nDo I think that municipalities should use federal infrastructure funds to build out municipal broadband solutions? This question was presented across a number of questions, actually. They ranged from questions asking me to rank my top three uses for infrastructure funding. As much as I think municipal broadband is important, I can\u0026rsquo;t quite put it ahead of things like roads, bridges, education, and clean water, and the survey creators know that. Who do I trust to handle my security more? Who will invest in innovation? Who find the money for upgrades? There were a whole series of these questions that were almost always structured as an either/or, rather than on a Likert scale. The problem, of course, is that these issues are not black or white. There were questions like, Knowing that some municipal broadband efforts have failed, would you still support your taxes going to invest in municipal broadband? None of the question primed the survey-taker to have a negative image of broadband companies, even though these corporations sometimes fail, even though some cable companies functions as de facto monopolies, even though some of these corporations receive taxpayer dollars in the form of subsidies or other tax carve outs.\nPerhaps the worst of the questions, however, were a pair that seem primed for political sloganeering. Two parallel questions asked for terms that most favorably and least favorably describe internet service funded by taxpayers and included: government-owned broadband, government-funded broadband, municipal broadband, taxpayer-funded broadband, and a few more variations. The net result is clearly to determine the language that will be fed to politicians during the upcoming mid-term election cycle.\nAfter numerous follow-up questions along the lines of knowing this\u0026hellip;would you still support municipal broadband efforts? For each of those prompts, I continued to reply honestly on the scale with \u0026ldquo;Yes, I would strongly support municipal broadband.\u0026rdquo; The truth is simply that there are parts of the country, including in my state, where the greedy existing national broadband internet providers have grossly failed to invest in infrastructure that meets the demands that this country requires to provide a minimum level of service to those who need it the most, often while illegally misappropriating money from the government or existing customers that is specifically earmarked for that purpose. So, yes, in those areas especially, I most definitely support efforts by local government to improve the lives of its citizens when businesses simply don\u0026rsquo;t care to do so.\nThis particular survey left a particularly bad taste in my mouth, but at least I did what I could to recognize the slant and respond as best as I could with the options provided.\nBlog 23/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"12 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-12/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A Slanted Survey","type":"posts"},{"content":"Waving on the bough\nBeckoning others to join\nLeafy ‘chutes away\nDoes the railway track\nExperience the journey\nAs the seasons pass?\n","date":"11 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-11-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2021-10-11","type":"posts"},{"content":"This may prove to be a short entry, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see. While I am still expecting that I may remain in higher education, I\u0026rsquo;m not limiting myself to that and am regularly reviewing positions that are open in my surrounding towns at companies, non-profits, and B-corporations. To that end, one of my biggest challenges is to reframe my higher education experience in a way that will be meaningful to an HR person. Specifically, I need to rewrite my 8-10 page curriculum vitae, which has been the path forward for every position I\u0026rsquo;ve held in the past 20 years, as a 1-2 page resumé that reframes and distills my experience and achievements. On the one or two occasions I done this in the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve found it to be a daunting experience.\nAt the outset I also understand that an ideal resumé is even more tailored to a given position than a CV often will be. My first goal, however, is simply to see how I might employ a scalpel and a jeweler\u0026rsquo;s loupe to the former in order to bring out the diamond within. To date, most of this customization has gone into my cover letter, with minor edits to the rest of the CV. The conversion, not unlike the preparation for last week\u0026rsquo;s interview, is going to require some challenging introspection. And, though I mentioned a scalpel, I may need the equivalent of a bone saw instead.\nAccording to one website, resumés:\nhighlight relevant experiences are results-oriented, providing quantitative, measurable details use action verbs to highlight skills, experiences, and achievements strategically highlight activities if they demonstrate key transferable skills valued by the employer With the news today that I am no longer moving forward to the next round with the school I interviewed with last week, I suppose it becomes even more of an imperative for me to knuckle-down on this activity and see where I land.\nBlog 22/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"11 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-11/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Curriculum Vitae to Resumé Conversion","type":"posts"},{"content":"Blogging has taken a backseat this week to the interview preparation I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing.\nFor the first time that I can recall, I was provided with a list of questions that the first-round search committee would be asking, a fact I mentioned in my previous post.\nI spent most of this week preparing my answers to those questions. In total, I wrote about 5000 words in response to the eight prompts. Knowing that the interview would last an hour, with a planned reserve of 10 minutes for any questions I might have, that works out to about 6 minutes of response time per question.\nThe questions covered typical areas for a manager, such as experience with collaboration and building relationships, effective communication, long- and short-term planning, strategic leadership, as well as my contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nThen, there was my logistical planning for the interview itself. I structured my responses in a document, using paragraph styles in order to build an interactive table of contents that would make it easier to jump to each question regardless of the order in which they were presented. I positioned the document in the center of my field of view, below the web cam at the top the screen. I increased the zoom percentage of the document to about 160% and chose a font that is designed for on-screen reading (Calibri).\nAhead of time, I launched my Zoom software and updated it as well. After the update, I restarted it and cursed briefly when the new update caused the initial video color temperature to be off, way off. It looked like I was in a fire tower in the middle of a blaze at the end of the day. I checked the video settings to no avail, but simply turning the video off and on cleared things up. [Sometimes it is sad how much this stereotypical action actually solves the problem.] I next confirmed that audio was routing correctly through my Airpods.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t, not at first. I only had sound in one ear and no mic. So, I shutdown Zoom again, and checked to ensure the audio settings were working correctly on my computer. Then, I relaunched Zoom. The color temperature issue happened again, but I toggled the fix, then rechecked the audio. When all was well, I preset my Zoom conferencing window so that it would be adjacent to the document, but smaller so that I had awareness of the committee members, but was not visually distracted by them. With everything set, I closed out of my Zoom connection.\nNext, with my mouse finger on the scroll wheel, I opened up the stopwatch on my iPhone and read through my responses\u0026hellip;once again. I was able to read through all of the responses in less than six minutes each, a good sign. The longest took about four and a half minutes. However, I know from years of presentation work that practice timing rarely aligns with real-world time. One tip: never simply read the words in your head or just on your lips. You must read the words aloud. For presentations that will be in person, you need to be standing, or in whatever your natural presentation state will be, as well. It changes your timings. I also know that just reading aloud is not enough to provide an accurate time. Your emotional state during the presentation, or in this case, my interview, is going to affect the timing as well. You think it might make you speed things up, but in reality you end up adding some pauses or some um\u0026rsquo;s or uh\u0026rsquo;s along the way. For me, I wanted my answers to feel natural and not like I was simply reading, so I added hand motions or thoughtful pauses, along with some genuine, but careful, ad lib, too. Reading through my responses permitted me the additional opportunity to make further edits to my answers. When I finished, I returned the cursor to the top of the document.\nFinal preparations included a trip to the restroom and to the kitchen for a tumbler of water. Back in front of the screen, I turned on Do Not Disturb mode and I put my phone into Airplane mode.\nTwo minutes before the interview, I clicked on the Zoom link. Once again, I was basking in a golden glow, but thankfully I knew that I was going to be in the Zoom waiting room, so I connected without video initially. As soon as I was out of the lobby, the video of the host started up. I quickly toggled video on and set the screen mode to gallery to place everyone in Brady Bunch boxes. I then quickly clicked over to my document so that my mouse and keyboard were focused on the right application.\nThe document layout helped tremendously in keeping my eyeline as close as possible to the camera position. Using the scroll wheel allowed me to move my text up, much like a teleprompter without losing the eyeline. The table of contents panel worked beautifully in helping to navigate quickly to the next question.\nOverall, I think the interview went well. The introductory question ended up being phrased differently, which threw me off just slightly out of the gate, but I recovered. The table of content navigation largely went well, but for one of the final questions, I simply could not find my notes and no amount of jumping or scrolling seemed to be help. I was convinced that somehow I must have accidentally deleted the entire thing. I had probably 30 seconds of hesitant response as I scoured through the document, but wanting not to look like I was doing so. This is where the pre-reading practice really helped out. Once I gave up on finding my notes, I had to go from memory, which I did and brought things back on track.\nWhat I lost in the process, however, was time. I finished my responses with only two minutes left on the schedule. Then, a minute was used up by the committee talking about the shortage of time before allowing one question and a brief reply. C\u0026rsquo;est la vie. The Q\u0026amp;A and the interview finished just two and a half minutes over time. I said my thank you\u0026rsquo;s to the committee, was moved back to the lobby, and disconnected from Zoom.\nAll in all, though, I thought it went very well. The questions were good and allowed me, as a candidate, to answer in a thoughtful way, which I think is what the committee was hoping for. As an unemployed individual, the questions were also helpful as an opportunity to be self-reflective. I may not love it, but it is a net good.\nToday, I sent my emails to the search firm and the committee. Now, I wait to learn if I make it to the second round.\nBlog 20/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"8 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-08/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Interview","type":"posts"},{"content":"A day\u0026rsquo;s end ramble\nGolden boughs turn away from\nMy outstretched shadow\n","date":"6 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-06-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2021-10-06","type":"posts"},{"content":"When we were students, one of the things we often wished we had were the questions to an upcoming exam, thinking that we would then know exactly what to study or, more importantly, believing that we would simply prepare sufficiently to have the correct answers ahead of time. But, as many teachers know, having the questions is no guarantee of being able to produce the correct answers on an exam. There can be a myriad reasons for this. If we don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand the subject material, simply having the questions does not ensure that our brain will link to the correct answer under exam duress. We should have all learned that lesson with the simple spelling tests that we grew up with.\nEach week we were provided with the list of words and we simply needed to correctly spell them when the words were read aloud. The lists were rarely even that long. Still, we would make mistakes. In some cases, those spelling mistakes follow us for the rest of our lives, two neurons so enraptured with one another that they fail to realize how wrong their pairing is, while the surrounding neurons blast extra jolts of electricity to separate the bonds long enough for the correct spelling to appear on our paper or screen.\nWith essay questions it is even more of a challenge. Having the question prompts put you in the position of having to stress out over your answer for even longer, like submitting yourself to the exam twice. Sure, you can make notes, perhaps an outline to organize your thoughts and the direction you plan to take, but still you must use that map to actually sail your course through the testing waters and avoid the hazards along the way, hoping that you arrive at your destination safely.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s kinds of how I feel this week. I have an interview coming up for a fairly important job. The interview is the exam, and the subject matter is me, something you\u0026rsquo;d think I know well. The company has even provided the questions I\u0026rsquo;ll be asked so that the time spent during the interview can be as efficient as possible. And yet, I\u0026rsquo;m still procrastinating. I\u0026rsquo;m actually moving on to the prep work after I complete the blog entry, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to do the work this weekend.\nAs much as we all know our own story, for me I still have a hard time telling it under the pressure of an interview. We are taught that humility is a good thing, an interview flip that\u0026ndash;we are expected to sing our own praises. But it is important that we know where the line is between boasting about our accomplishments and simply describing them honestly. I appreciate having the questions ahead of time, but there is a part of me that absolutely hates it as well. Okay, \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; is too strong a word. There is something different about preparing for the unknown versus preparing for the known.\nI am discomforted by introspection. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to the feeling we have when we hear a recording of our voice. I know that introspection and reflection are positive things that help us grow, but introspection also forces us to confront something that we fear professionally all the time. It is a manifestation of the impostor syndrome and the question, \u0026ldquo;Am I worthy?\u0026rdquo; As a manager, it challenges me also because I often feel that my success is usually due to the work of my team, so it is always difficult for me to see and to articulate my role in the successes I\u0026rsquo;ve been a part of.\nNevertheless, I will proceed. I will grab the mirror to hold before me, and dust off the cobwebs in my mind to revisit past work in order to tell the story of me, to sell the story of me, to this next highest bidder. In the end, I know there will still be a mental skirmish as two sides of my psyche fight to move the line of \u0026ldquo;Will I be enough?\u0026rdquo; in one direction or another. I can tell myself now that regardless of the outcome, \u0026ldquo;I am enough\u0026rdquo; but there will always be a part that is wounded or bruised by the encounter should I not move forward in the search. And I will assuage those parts with reminders that I am more than enough\u0026hellip;for someone or someplace else.\nBlog 19/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"4 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-04/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"When the subject under review is me","type":"posts"},{"content":"Clouds burst in delight\nWatching dancers take the stage\nUmbrella ballet\n","date":"1 October 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-10-01-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2021-10-01","type":"posts"},{"content":"As mentioned in part 1, the other duo who influenced my childhood and Saturday mornings were Sid \u0026amp; Marty Krofft. And, like Hanna-Barbera, their works existed for several years before I was a regular consumer, but would have an unknowable connection to my future as well.\nWhile The Banana Splits was the first series in production, in 1968, I feel fairly strongly that the first Krofft production to come across my toddler eyes was H. R. Pufnstuf. Who can say with absolute certainty how things are ordered in the memory of a 2-3 year old mind? Perhaps it is the case that I simply have more deeply ingrained memories of The Banana Splits in syndication, and a clear recollection of its decline from a 60 minute syndicated show to a 30 minute show. But that Pufnstuf is simply an earlier pin on the mental timeline. The brain works in mysterious ways, but this is the order I\u0026rsquo;m sticking with!\nH. R. Pufnstuf may be my earliest awareness of narrative television. Each episode told a story, there were a variety of characters, and there was a general delineation of good vs. evil. The Banana Splits was essentially a variety show, and Sesame Street and The Electric Company were educational variety shows. And while the Looney Tunes told stories, they were short and simply not the same as having real people in them. I\u0026rsquo;m no child development specialist and without research I can\u0026rsquo;t say when a child\u0026rsquo;s brain is able to differentiate between human and cartoon characters, but I have very different memory experiences of live-action and animated programs. I am convinced that one of the keys to the success of the Krofft programs was the blend of human and non-human (costumed) performers. I believe that provides a different connection within the mind of a child, in comparison to a purely animated program.\nAnother element that stands out in the Krofft universe is the presence of danger and menace. Danger and menace are hallmarks of mythology and fairytales. And, I think it is undeniable that many of the Krofft villains owe their characterizations to Margaret Hamilton\u0026rsquo;s Wicked Witch of the West role in The Wizard of Oz, and some of the Disney villains, too. Undeniable, also, is that Pufnstuf is direct riff on The Wizard of Oz, and also probably one of the darkest of the Krofft shows. Lidsville clearly borrows from Alice\u0026rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland, so I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming anything particularly unique about the shows in this regard. Land of the Lost is a dark family drama with danger everywhere. Jay Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Dr. Shrinker is terrifying in many regards, helped along by assistant Billy Barty. Even Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, while it has some slapstick moments, to lessen the Lovecraftian horror of the sea monsters, is always played with a straight face. Far Out Space Nuts and The Lost Saucer were more farcical, the casting of Bob Denver and Chuck McCann, and Jim Nabors and Ruth Buzzi1, respectively, make that clear, but still involve dangerous elements.\nLike the Hanna-Barbera works, the world of Sid \u0026amp; Marty Krofft may not have risen to the level of high art, and many may even dismiss the works as derivative pablum to rot kids minds, but I don\u0026rsquo;t buy into it, even now in my 50s. Maybe it is more believable that these shows had a greater influence on my liberal ideology. After all, many of these shows featured diverse casts and told stories of working with people and creatures who were very different to overcome oppressive forces in the world. Many featured young people whose voices and actions mattered. In the era of Women\u0026rsquo;s Lib, Electra Woman and Dyna Girl were the only human superheroes in the Krofft pantheon. There was a lot of tolerance and an undying optimism in these morality tales. Unlike some of the animated shows of the 80s, though, I am of the opinion that the Krofft shows treated their audience with a bit more respect and with less sugar-coating. There\u0026rsquo;s a message of perseverance even through hardship. That\u0026rsquo;s why these shows have stayed with me for as long as they have, and why I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have grown up with them in the 1970s.\nThe Krofft limelight began to fade in the 1980s. But one prime-time show burrowed its way into my memory and may have contributed to my interest in Japan. On March 1, 1980, NBC debuted Pink Lady and Jeff, starring the Japanese megastar disco-pop idol duo Pink Lady. I have no idea why my family chose to watch, but we did and I never forgot about it when it disappeared after 5 episodes. It was bad, for many reasons that can be read on the Wikipedia page. Nevertheless, when I ended up in Japan on exchange 8 years later, I knew who Pink Lady were and it provided a connection between myself and my new Japanese friends. While Pink Lady were no longer chart toppers themselves, their musical legacy lives on still to this day, both in karaoke and in the numerous music programs that regular feature retrospective performances that never let musical memories fade.\nSide notes:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t mention The Bugaloos above, but that show always held a very special attraction for me, perhaps because it seemed to go away too soon, or maybe it was the combination of music and story, like an even-more kid-friendly version of The Monkees, but maybe I just had a crush on Caroline \u0026ldquo;Joy\u0026rdquo; Ellis when it aired in syndication in 1978.\nSometimes, I was able to catch a replay of the Pufnstuf movie on a UHF station, too. I learned about Cass Elliot there first, and several years later became a fan of The Mamas and Papas.\nKids today will never understand the anticipation and delayed gratification that was required before DVRs and everything-on-demand.\nBlog 18/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nRuth Buzzi is still funny as ever.

I can\u0026rsquo;t recall the exact trigger that led me to revisit that garden path again, but it likely may have been related to a recent birthday. It still does not seem possible that 1975 is further in my past today than World War II was when I was a child in 1975!\nFor me, while the Looney Toons and the works of Jim Henson probably are of greater significance, four other names came to define almost exclusively my memories of children\u0026rsquo;s television growing up in the 1970s. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera provided nearly all of the animation (outside of Warner Bros. studios), and Sid \u0026amp; Marty Krofft brought forth a Technicolor kaleidoscope of imaginative live action shows. I know that all of them were simple and formulaic, but they were the bright moments of joy on my Saturday mornings. Every September I eagerly awaited the Saturday morning fall TV lineup preview show that aired on Friday night before the new shows began.\nMany of the Hanna-Barbera shows I watched had first aired in the late 50s and throughout the 60s, and were already running in syndication when they entered my life: The Flintstones, Huckleberry Hound, Top Cat, The Jetsons, Yogi Bear, Magilla Gorilla, Quick Draw McGraw, The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show, Space Ghost, The Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, and a particular favorite, Jonny Quest. The bridge to the 1970s was probably The Banana Splits, which blended live-action set pieces and introduced short animated episodes interspersed within the hour. I still think that The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which started out as its own show and was eventually rolled into syndication as part of The Banana Splits, was ground-breaking as a children\u0026rsquo;s show for its combination of live actors in animated scenes.\nDuring the 1970s, Hanna-Barbera released 68 new shows, a staggering number. Although most only lasted for one season, many of them ran in syndication for years afterward. The standouts for me, probably as much for the way they clawed their way deeply into my memory cells through repeat showings as anything, include: Josie and the Pussycats, The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan, Sealab 2020, Speed Buggy, Super Friends, Hong Kong Phooey, Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, The Great Grape Ape Show, Jabberjaw, and The New Shmoo. There were also numerous iterations of many of these shows and characters, though I think Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space is the one I remember most fondly. Looking back, I think it must have influenced my interest in women rock musicians and even some Japanese animé, given the overwhelming \u0026ldquo;cuteness\u0026rdquo; of Melody and the alien Bleep. The animé aesthetic is certainly there. Of course, there are many, many more characters in the Hanna-Barbera universe and encoded in my memory cells.\nIn 1979, I moved from the northeast to the southwest. The move also marked my transition from elementary school to junior high and the natural, gradual progression away from Saturday morning cartoons, as school work increased and there were other activities to draw my attention. Among them were computers, early video games like the Atari VCS, and Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons.\nDuring the 1980s, kids started to see the rise of cartoons as 30-minute commercials, with the emergence of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe, Care Bears and My Little Pony and Friends. Sure, the 70s shows had product tie-ins, but as that amped up in the 80s, the quality of the programming went down, many would argue.1 Certainly much of the idealism of the 70s that was imbued in many of the programs gave way to even more soullessness and crass consumerism of later fare, with some exceptions.\nNone of my childhood TV was high art, but the shows of the 70s seemed more connected to vaudevillian roots and in many ways seemed to be more closely aligned with the television programming for adults, but for a different, younger audience. And, in fact, the targeted age demographic dropped from the 70s to the 80s. Some of this can be attributed to the increase of television sets in U.S. households, since more sets in the home meant that adults and children could watch programming separately.2 But, there were other industry factors at work as well. As some parents complained about violence and scenes of peril, the content became more sanitized. In the process, too, the complexity of the language decreased and stories became less sophisticated. Even the animation became more simplistic, with fewer individual cels per second of screen time. It would take nearly a decade for things to shift back, thanks to cable television channels like Nickelodeon switching on.\nSeveral years ago, I really enjoyed the chance to revisit some of the Hanna-Barbera character during my visit to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) as part of their Animation exhibit. The exhibit itself is gone now and has been repackaged as a more generic animation exhibit that can be rented by other museums, so I\u0026rsquo;m thankful for the opportunity.\nIn part 2, I\u0026rsquo;ll look back fondly at the world of Sid \u0026amp; Marty Krofft.\nBlog 17/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nI understand that we all have a particular fondness for the shows that shaped our individual childhood years, and nostalgia for 80s is on the rise with recent remakes of He-Man, She-Ra, and others. But, it is a documented fact that many of the cartoons in the 80s were designed from the beginning to sell toys, ever since the success of Star Wars and the accompanying toys from Kenner.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTelevision programming for children no longer had any reason at all to target a wider age range.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"29 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-29/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Saturday mornings in the 70s - Part 1","type":"posts"},{"content":"I think that next on my list of things to clean and clear out are my numerous \u0026ldquo;ham\u0026rdquo; email subscriptions. If I do not check my two email accounts for two days, I find myself quickly reviewing and purging about 200 emails. None of those emails are work-related, as the accounts are both personal.\nWhen I am purge processing, I\u0026rsquo;m able to delete easily 95% of the messages very quickly just from the headers that appear in the list. Another 3% probably fall into the category of useful information, such as bill notifications and payment processing, or other organizations with whom I conduct personal business. 1% fall into the category of interesting distractions, such as Twitter, Digg, Quora, or other digest emails. Depending on my time and mood, these will either get immediately trashed or kept for a quick review after the initial purge. And the final 1% are the items that I think may have some educational or informational value should I choose to hold on to them. Though, in reality, I likely will never go back.\nBut, to be honest, most of those numbers are just raw estimates. I\u0026rsquo;ve thought of using my own email as a data set for developing and training my own AI assistant to help with the processing, but haven\u0026rsquo;t progressed far enough into that space to move it forward yet.\nOver the years I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a number of different strategies for organization, but nothing has really stuck. Since one of my accounts is a Gmail account, I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much left it up to Google to handle the sorting. The problem I run into there is that Google seems to really not want to delete my email. It is one thing for me to choose to tag/file a message and archive it to remove it from my Inbox, but if I delete it from my Inbox, I really want that message to go away. Instead, there are messages in that special All Mail folder that will not go away unless I delete them from there.\nBut with a little fall cleaning, maybe I can whittle down both that black hole of 50K+ messages, as well as prevent a few more from coming in at all.\nWish me luck.

It works, as a sitting dog, a baby chick, or one of a myriad other interpretations, because that is, ultimately, what origami is all about. How can I fold this two dimensional piece of paper in such a way that it conjures for the viewer the appearance or the essence of something else?\nWe are in a completely new origami universe today, one in which realism seems to lead the field, and I completely get it. The fandom has, in large part, skated to where that particular puck has been sliding for quite some time.\nI bring up origami as, perhaps, the last of my posts regarding the project to weed my browser bookmarks. The folder with the largest number of links, and the folder in which all but one or two were still active, is my origami folder.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been folding ever since I was handed my first origami book back in the mid-1970s. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall the title, but I can still see the gloss on the cover of the thin paperback, as well as the bamboo illustrated background. While most of the models were pretty simple for my 8-9 year-old self, the one I challenged to fold was the crane, though unfortunately what I had learned to mastery was the easier flapping bird variation, rather than the ori-tsuru that was far more common when I found myself in Japan more than a decade later.\nAs I got older, I acquired more books. I remember one of my first big tomes was Kunihiko Kasahara\u0026rsquo;s original hardcover Origami Omnibus. The next landmark book was Robert Lang\u0026rsquo;s The Complete Book of Origami. Next came Jun Maekawa\u0026rsquo;s Viva Origami, which was edited by Kasahara. But, Origami Omnibus was also responsible for introducing me Mitsunobu Sonobe\u0026rsquo;s unit origami, which naturally then flowed to Tomoko Fuse\u0026rsquo;s books on unit or modular origami. And folders continued to up the game. While Steve and Megumi Biddle\u0026rsquo;s The New Origami introduced new models that leaned more toward simpler, elegant, and fun models, David Brill\u0026rsquo;s Brilliant Origami presented a range from simple to, yes, brilliant. And the library of books continues to grow. My last acquisitions were Makoto Yamaguchi\u0026rsquo;s two volume series The Beauty of Origami and The Graceful of Origami.\nNeedless to say, while I was never a great folder, my interest has never waned, which is why the origami websites remain a good size part of my bookmarked pages. They include:\nThe British Origami Society OrigamiUSA Robert J. Lang\u0026rsquo;s Origami Japan Origami Academic Society (in Japanese) Origami Heaven Origami Resource Center Origami with Rachel Katz Kusudama me! Meenakshi Mukerji\u0026rsquo;s Origamee Jim Plank\u0026rsquo;s Origami Page (Modular) and the Origami Database There are, of course, many more site, books, models, and artists, along with YouTube videos. I\u0026rsquo;m simply glad that the community has grown as large as it has and is such a vibrant artistic hub, despite the ugliness of what has transpired around conventions and some leaders within the community during the past several years.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen it already, I would encourage you to find and watch the origami documentary, Between the Folds.\nBlog 15/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"27 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-27/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Do dog-eared pages count as origami?","type":"posts"},{"content":"I first met Chris Gulker at the New Media Consortium Conference hosted by the University of British Columbia in Vancouver back in June of 2004. He was working at Adobe at the time and had come to talk about the Atmosphere platform that Adobe had acquired and had been building out as a kind of 3D web of connected worlds. This was only my second NMC Conference but I was very interested in immersive technology such as QuickTimeVR, Second Life and other products that were beginning to emerge.\nThere was gala event, held at the Museum of Anthropology, and Chris and I struck up a conversation about photography, technology, his work at Adobe, my work in higher education, his blogging on the Frontier platform developed by Dave Winer, and the technology of immersive environments. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why my meeting with Chris stood out among everyone one else I had met, but it did. His was a peaceful personality and our conversation flowed easily. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t running around pressing the flesh, he was not beating his drum loudly. He was present, and engaging, and fully participating in our conversation, both sharing and listening.\nAfter the conference I kept his card and began following along with his blog at Gulker.com. It was a delightful mix of photography, gardening, travel, technology, world events, and personal diary. It was a regular read for me, so it was a bit of gut punch when in late October of 2006, Chris shared that he had been diagnosed with a malignant glioma brain tumor.\nOver the next several years, Chris continued to blog about all the things he had been blogging about, but also now included his fight against and life with the tumor. It was intensely personal and also very public. And it also created a sense of closeness despite the distance. I followed along for the next four years, until his battle was at an end and Chris was at peace, his wife reporting, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a wrap\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; for the final blog entry.\nThe Internet Archive maintains a record of Chris\u0026rsquo; blog, both the original site (www.gulker.com) and the Wordpress version (gulker.wordpress.com) he migrated to in 2006. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it persists, and also that the Wordpress site is still online as well.\nAt this very moment it occurs to me also that he was the same age when I met him as I am now, which hits in a particular way. Chris\u0026rsquo; blog will always remain a very special place on the Internet for me, connecting me to an individual in a way I had not experienced before then.\nLike old photographs or cards from my son stored in a box, Chris Gulker\u0026rsquo;s site remains in my bookmark list.\nBlog 14/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"24 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-24/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Chris Gulker, Bookmarked","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/in-memoriam/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"In Memoriam","type":"tags"},{"content":"Curled leaves fall upon\nBlades of grass heavy with dew;\nTears for the arbor\n","date":"23 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-23-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2021-09-23","type":"posts"},{"content":"As mentioned yesterday, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a bit of housekeeping on my iMac and turned my attention to my internet browser bookmarks, which can often be a place where memories go to die rather than live again. You know the feeling, you\u0026rsquo;re web surfing and come across a particularly useful or interesting site and decide to bookmark it to revisit later. Except, we don\u0026rsquo;t often actually get around to the actual revisiting part of the process. Nevertheless, like using Google Streetview to stroll through one\u0026rsquo;s childhood neighborhood, I decided to perform that particular trip down the Internet memory lane to see what my old brain remembered, to see what still lived, changed or otherwise.\nI do remember, actually, about a decade ago attempting to create a single set of bookmarks that I could use across all of my browsers and spent no small amount of time organizing folders and links. I even downloaded some applications to help remove duplicates or dead links, though I\u0026rsquo;d be hard-pressed to name even one of those tools now. The problem that I ran into, however, was that each browser wanted to handle the bookmarks in just a slightly different way, most notably naming the the collection of link as either bookmarks or favorites, referring to the privileged few to live on the \u0026ldquo;favorites bar\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bookmarks toolbar\u0026rdquo; or something else. So, right out of the box you can\u0026rsquo;t have just one set of consistent links. So, that certainly worked against a unified approach.\nThen, some of you may recall, there was, for a while, the very popular del.icio.us website that allowed you to externalize your bookmarks to a hosted service. As an early social network service, you could share your bookmarks as well. People started including their delicio.us link on business cards and websites, too. Unfortunately, the free service was acquired by Yahoo! and then passed around like a white elephant gift for a few years until its demise in 2017.1\nBut back to the cleaning project. With del.icio.us gone, I have mostly relied on my search engines to take me back to interesting sites, acknowledging that I may lose some to the fog of memory. Every now and then, though, I will find myself down a particular rabbit hole that may lead me back to my bookmarks, either to create a new folder or to revisit old ones. That has not happened recently, however. I should say that the rabbit hole journeys continue, but without the bookmarks.\nTackling the list, I opened up two separate browser windows, one to edit the bookmarks, and another to follow them from the sidebar. In the editing window, I expanded each folder and performed a cursory review to remove \u0026ldquo;feed:\u0026rdquo; links and links to commercial sites that I have no need to ever visit, and which probably only existed as a set of defaults that once came pre-installed with a browser. These include network sites like ABC, CBS, and NBC, sports sites like ESPN that I never visited, a few entertainment/gossip sites like E!, some weather sites, several news sites like CNN, FoxNews, and the New York Times, and perhaps some educational sites like National Geographic, or NatGeo as it is often referred to now. I\u0026rsquo;m not linking any of those sites here since there is simply no need.\nWith those sites eliminated and almost like performing tombstone rubbings, I began to click on the remaining links to see which ones still existed. Unsurprisingly, there were a number of dead links, but many of the sites still existed, frozen in time, alive, but in suspended animation. After all, someone is still paying to renew the domain on these sites, even if the content hasn\u0026rsquo;t been updated in a decade.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s 43 Folders, Blogs of War, Christopher Lydon Interviews, and The Creative Science Centre by Dr. Jonathan Hare, all in their late-90s/early-00\u0026rsquo;s web glory.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s the collection of blogs and forums for expatriates in Japan, including F*cked Gaijin, Kurt Easterwood\u0026rsquo;s HMMN, and Mike Clarke\u0026rsquo;s Hunkabutta. There\u0026rsquo;s also Japanophile pages like Japan Zone, the forum for Eurasians, EurasianNation, and the mothballed, but still dark, Asian Extreme Cinema review site of Mandi Apple, Snowblood Apple.\nI remember attending an educational technology conference and learning about Inform 7, a tool for creating interactive fiction. Naturally, there are a few examples on the list, including Andrew Plotkin\u0026rsquo;s Shade, Shawn Graham\u0026rsquo;s Stranger in These Parts, and Adam Cadre\u0026rsquo;s 9:05. If those interest you, follow the breadcrumbs back to Zarf\u0026rsquo;s Interactive Fiction, playfic, and Adam\u0026rsquo;s interactive fiction pages, respectively.\nIn the realm of non-interactive fiction, there are literature review sites like the Los Angeles Review of Books, n+1, The Millions, and Kim Ukura\u0026rsquo;s Sophisticated Dorkiness.\nAmong some of the grab bag selection of sites are the MSSIAH Cartridge (formerly Prophet64), a MIDI hardware cartridge for the Commodore 64, the very problematic language experiment The Dialectizer, an Urban Dictionary-like site called Word Spy, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, and remember LYCOS?\nFor me it has been an interesting trip to revisit these sites. Some I have kept in my bookmarks list, and others I\u0026rsquo;ve let go. And there are a couple more that I simply cannot let go of, but I\u0026rsquo;ll cover those in the next entry tomorrow.\nBlog 13/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nI believe it may still be alive, but with an expired certificate, it is better simply to assume \u0026ldquo;there be dragons.\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"23 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-23/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Bookmarked memories","type":"posts"},{"content":"For the past week or so I\u0026rsquo;ve been logging into my computer only to find a message onscreen that the system has run out of memory. This is a recent phenomenon and I\u0026rsquo;m still in the dark about what is causing it, which is a bit frustrating, but it did kick off a bit of a journey for me today.\nI started with a web search, because that\u0026rsquo;s what we modern humans do, specifically to see if others had reported the issue recently. Unfortunately, most of what I found was not particularly timely nor relevant, with a number of \u0026ldquo;articles\u0026rdquo; simply being software push pieces\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;How to solve your memory problems? Buy our software.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve been using a Macintosh for decades at this point. I have not had to deal with memory issues since the pre-OSX days. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason the RamDoubler product was a best-seller and an essential piece of software back in the Mac OS 7-9 days. At least the recent memory issues have rarely locked up the entire system1, as was pretty common two decades ago. Nonetheless, I did open up the Activity Monitor app to see what was going on.\nOne thing that I have noticed over the past several years is the surprising number of Apple system agents running in the background, some with notable names that send to my web search site to learn more about. These include: bird, familycircled, deleted, fileproviderd, imagent, parsecd, pbs, rapportd, reversetemplated, spindump_agent, and VTDecoderXPCService. I can certainly guess what some of those might be for, but I really have no concrete idea without looking them up. Others, like adprivacyd, DiskUnmountWatcher, and SocialPushAgent I can make a pretty informed guess about. But, I digress.\nBeyond the system services, there were certainly a few application agents for software I am no longer using, so I decided to prune a few of those. I started with the pieces that had identifiable uninstallers, thank you Razer and Logitech. I then downloaded the free AppCleaner and continued with a few more. I uninstalled Amazon Luna, since I really have way too many games already to justify paying for a new service2. I uninstalled the VPN software used by my former employers. I uninstalled a few Chrome apps. Then, I restarted.\nI highly doubt that the software removals will influence overall performance, but it is always nice to purge periodically. I had already run Onyx3 about a week ago, so I was already feeling the system was a bit cleaner. I did, however, take a moment to pop open the About this Mac screen to review the specs. 8GB of main memory has served me well since buying this 27\u0026quot; late-2012 iMac refurbished back in 2013. It occurred to me, though, that this is one of the last of several models released before Apple began soldering memory to the main board. Could I upgrade the memory? And, if I can, might this be one of the last of my investments into this machine to get a couple more years from it? Turns out that I can, so I researched that a bit, comparison shopped, and placed an order with Newegg for an additional 16GB of Crucial memory, and carried on with the purging.\nNext on the list was a chore that I have been avoiding for probably 5-7 years. It was time to tackle the web bookmarks! But, like going through old photo boxes, that was a trip down memory lane, and a topic worthy of its own entry tomorrow.\nBlog 12/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nSure, sometimes I do get encounter a complete lockup, but it was a much more frequent occurrence back before OS X with its spinning beachball.

More often it is the case of the latter rather than the former, but one leads to the other. A good writer, so they say, is one who is more disciplined about their approach, setting aside a set amount of time each day and committing to it. As an instructor, this was often the advice I gave to my students as well, because it is not limited to writing. To get better at any thing requires the discipline to constantly practice and improve. Of course, with many skills to be developed, it usually is not enough to simply to practice and, in fact, the companion to practice is guidance, whether from a teacher, an honest friend, or really just anyone other than oneself.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure that point about an outside reviewer is necessarily true with blogs, especially if they serve primarily as one\u0026rsquo;s non-private diary. If the purpose is simply to \u0026ldquo;off load\u0026rdquo; ideas, holding oneself to a set time is still important nonetheless.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;m a few days out from my last post so I am giving myself this 30 minutes to simply just type what comes to mind. The timer is already ticking down.\nWhat I was thinking about even before starting was how often I wish I could simply dictate these ideas to myself at night with my head on the pillow. I know I\u0026rsquo;m not alone when it comes to having one\u0026rsquo;s brain go into overtime right around the time when your body thinks it is time to rest. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it is the product of the brain having had to push everything else aside to help me get through the day and then deciding, \u0026ldquo;Oh, hello there. I see that you are finally free. Could we talk for a few minutes, or maybe a few hours if that\u0026rsquo;s okay? There is so much I\u0026rsquo;ve been saving up to share with you.\u0026rdquo; Meanwhile, the other part of you is thinking, \u0026ldquo;No, please, I just want to rest. Didn\u0026rsquo;t we already have a busy day, brain?\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes, the brain\u0026rsquo;s replies are helpful, like \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s cool. But I just thought it would be good to remind you about that thing you asked me not to forget for tomorrow. It might not be recorded on your phone yet, so I really just wanted to, you know, do my part to help out, but yeah that\u0026rsquo;s fine. That\u0026rsquo;s all for now.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then, of course, at other times the brain acts like it is tripping on chemicals someone must have smuggled in through one of your nine gates. Your brain screams, \u0026ldquo;I know you\u0026rsquo;re trying to sleep, but you just have to hear this amazing thing I came up with. Tomorrow you should go out and get some baling wire, light bulbs, a saxophone, a couple of tangerines, and a ferret. I swear, this will end poverty within five years!\u0026rdquo; as you struggle to push back, \u0026ldquo;No, it won\u0026rsquo;t, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have time for this. Just go to sleep. We\u0026rsquo;re clearly oxygen deprived and need some rest.\u0026rdquo;\nMost nights, the brain retreats, defeated, and simply clocks in for its shift on the autonomic nervous system factory floor. There are a few nights, however, where it is like trying to get a toddler to sleep and it is a battle of wills so you settle for a Pyrrhic victory when it comes.\nI know there are people who keep a notebook by the bed to help deal with the overactive brain, to help get those ideas out of the head and onto paper. Again, it reminds me of taking down a toddler\u0026rsquo;s Christmas wish list so they will just stop talking about it. I must confess that it took me probably 50 years to finally learn. I do keep a pen and tablet on or in the bedside table now. I don\u0026rsquo;t use it as frequently as I might, but it has come in handy as a way of simply just jot down a few to-do items for the coming day(s) lest I forget. I\u0026rsquo;ve been less reluctant to use it for other journaling or note taking purposes, mostly because I prefer not to turn the lights back on once I\u0026rsquo;ve turned them off.\nAlright, well, that just about wraps up my first 30 minute timed session. I know it is a ramble, but that\u0026rsquo;s beside the point. Training the writing muscle is the goal.

It did take me several days to decide on a model though, as I weighed the pros and cons of each of the options.\niPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air, 11\u0026quot; iPad Pro, 12.9\u0026quot; iPad Pro\nNot knowing how long it might be until I was employed again with a company-provided laptop, I decided that I wanted something that would last a while and serve in a pinch as a laptop replacement1, so that ruled out the iPad Mini.\niPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air, 11\u0026quot; iPad Pro, 12.9\u0026quot; iPad Pro\nI ruled out the iPad Pro as being too large, but also too close in price to a new laptop.\niPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air, 11\u0026quot; iPad Pro, 12.9\u0026quot; iPad Pro\nThe 2020 iPad had not really seen much of an update for a while.

Pricewise it was good, but the model felt somewhat end-of-life.2\niPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air, 11\u0026quot; iPad Pro, 12.9\u0026quot; iPad Pro\nFinally, down to the last two models. The iPad Air and 11\u0026quot; iPad Pro are nearly identical in just about every detail. I don\u0026rsquo;t even understand how the \u0026ldquo;Air\u0026rdquo; designation matters. They are the same size and nearly the same weight. Perhaps the extra cameras contribute to the 8g weight difference for the Pro, but the Pro even manages to have a slightly thinner depth. Beyond the additional cameras, the Pro camera array has TrueDepth technology, higher framerate, and Lidar capabilities, and the iPad includes a quad speaker set and the newer Apple M1 chip. For me, also, it had the right amount of memory/storage that I wanted, 128GB.\niPad Mini, iPad, iPad Air, 11\u0026quot; iPad Pro, 12.9\u0026quot; iPad Pro\nSo, in the end, that was my compromise. I could get 256GB for about $50 cheaper, but I feel the tech specs of the iPad Pro were worth the storage trade-off for my needs.\nI have to say, I\u0026rsquo;m quite pleased so far. As I usually do, I also ordered a new glass screen protector, a case, and a knock-off of the Apple Pencil 2. Those pieces arrived this week, so I\u0026rsquo;ll be getting more familiar with it all in the days ahead, and I am looking forward to the iPadOS 15 release on September 20.\nFWIW, I also have a portable Logitech K480 Bluetooth keyboard and the iPad Pro fits comfortably in the slot even with the new case on it.\nBlog 10/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nWhy not just get a laptop?

More specifically, music videos.\nSince the dawn of MTV, music videos have been a ground-breaking medium for artistic expression, fusing the best of aural and visual elements to enhance the musical experience. Not only do they showcase the work of musical artists, they have become the launch pad for directors, choreographers, actors, and dancers. And, they can simply be joy to watch.\nThe works of directors such as Spike Jonze, Michel Godry, Chris Cunningham, Jonas Akerlund, and John Landis stand out even today. While the work of directors like Sophie Muller, Melina Matsoukas, Diane Martel, Megan Thompson, and Hannah Lux Davis, continue to move the art forward.\nOk, so what is the connection to lingering? In the past couple of years I\u0026rsquo;ve begun to watch more dance music videos, especially those by KPop artists. Maybe because of the pandemic or for the joy of that comes from watching TikTok dance videos, or just for the sheer talent on display by artists who are able to sing and dance so well, but regardless of the reason, I\u0026rsquo;ve consumed more than I did in the past.\nWhat kills me though, are the non-stop cuts that have become the hallmark of the genre. It almost seems to be a competition to see who can include the most edits in three minutes. It is a visual assault that hearkens back to the blipverts of episode one of the Max Headroom television show. Sure, one can say that I\u0026rsquo;m just not hip enough to appreciate the new works, but I swear that isn\u0026rsquo;t it. As someone who has done video editing, I have great respect for the work of the directors and editors. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure how I would storyboard one of these videos to account for the all of the shots.\nWhat gets lost, however, is the work of the set designers, the costumers, and the lighting designers, not to mention the choreographers and the incredible dance performances of the artists and backup dancers. Thankfully, at least in the case of the KPop groups, they (or other professional choreographers) regularly release dance practice videos for fans to study. I understand, however, that many of the quick cuts may be purely artistic in their own right, with the popularity of multi-member KPop groups like BLACKPINK, Shinee, BTS, Red Velvet, and more, the quick cuts provide more time on screen for each member, lest a single member\u0026rsquo;s fans revolt and storm social media demanding boycotts or compensation.\nBut, gosh darnit, I want more time to linger over the work of all these talented individuals! I\u0026rsquo;m sure, though, that I\u0026rsquo;m just shaking my fist at the sky.\nBlog 7/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nP.S.

The first time I read a Yukio Mishima novel, Spring Snow, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish it, but when I revisited it a few years later I thoroughly enjoyed it and then read my way through the rest of the Sea of Fertility tetralogy and many more.\nIn the 90s, Seinfeld made a name for itself as the show about nothing, and yet in many Japanese films the viewer often feels much more like a voyeur dropping in on the lives of ordinary people where nothing and everything just kind of happens, slowly, as we watch, as we linger.\nThen, there are those works of incredible world-building in some novels or literary series in which we lose ourselves and never want to leave, eagerly anticipating the next release to transport us back. In film, the artistry of a cinematographer can be breathtaking, overwhelming our senses in a way that has us catching our breath in wonder, especially when the director gives us time to savor it.\nAs a videogamer, I can look back at the games that I have played and truly enjoyed in a similar way. I grew up with Pong and Atari Video Console games, and dropped plenty of quarters into arcade game machines, and though they offered a way to pass the time, they didn\u0026rsquo;t really offer me an escape the way that many adventure games did on my VIC-20 or C-64. Then, with the 90s, we were able to really get pulled into other worlds with 3D first-person shooters (playing Marathon on my Mac with headphones was even more of an experience, but I digress). It was Myst that provided a film-like narrative experience along with simply a beautiful world to explore.\nAlthough I confess to being a bit of a button-masher, the first-person shooters I\u0026rsquo;ve played the most are the ones that offered rich environments to explore, even while trying not to get killed. Bioshock\u0026rsquo;s underwater city of Rapture stands out for its beautiful and dystopian art nouveau environments. I think that early point-and-click adventure games are responsible to some degree for my need to explore, but open world games have me idling through spaces just for the wonder of it all. I really have enjoyed the new generation of Tomb Raider games for satisfying the combination of exploration and puzzle-solving, and beautiful and eerie environments. The game in which I have clocked the most hours is Guild Wars 2. I\u0026rsquo;m a horrible player, but mostly what I do is roam around the environment, just taking in the amazing artwork, the character creation, the scenery, the animation of the battle actions, the environmental effects. There have been major updates to the game that have completely reshaped the landscape and familiar landmarks in surprising ways, so there is always more to see and explore.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve had even less time to game, however. But, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to gravitate toward a genre of games that I avoided in the past a being too slow, much like my early experiences with Japanese film and literature years ago. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m finding myself enjoying JRPGs precisely because of the slow pace. I\u0026rsquo;m close to 40 hours into Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age and look forward to each opportunity to get a little more time with the world and the characters. I think it also appeals to the top-tier level of dad-humor associated with the monster names and designs. But, like Guild Wars 2, it is a fun world to explore and to simply linger in as I travel through it.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s my age, and maybe it is just the pandemic forcing us to be stuck at home for so long, that this \u0026ldquo;longing to linger\u0026rdquo; is just so resonant for me right now.\nInterestingly enough, though, deciding to write about a \u0026ldquo;longing to linger\u0026rdquo; came from a completely different source, but I\u0026rsquo;ll write about that in a part 2 to come.\nBlog 6/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"12 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-12/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A longing to linger (part 1)","type":"posts"},{"content":"There are songs that were not written to be part of soundtracks, and there are those that take on a completely different life by being part of soundtracks. Like the wine chosen by a sommelier to perfectly enhance your dining experience, these songs rise above their original release to become the perfect pairing for a film scene or story.\nWatching the new trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, Jefferson Airplane\u0026rsquo;s 1967 song \u0026ldquo;White Rabbit\u0026rdquo; by Grace Slick is the perfect accompaniment to the trailer. While it is not the first film to feature the song, it lands just right, giving the trailer both the tension and otherworldliness it needs. On a side note, the Wikipedia entry for \u0026ldquo;White Rabbit\u0026rdquo; is worth a read not only for the backstory on the song but also to learn about the influences from Miles Davis and Ravel.\nCertainly there are other examples of perfect music/film pairings. For film buffs or those of a certain age, an iconic one is Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Ride of the Valkyries\u0026quot; played as helicopters descend into battle in Francis Ford Coppola\u0026rsquo;s Apocalypse Now. And in a similar vein, another that comes to mind for me is Carl Orff\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;O Fortuna\u0026rdquo; from Carmina Burana played as the land revives following Perceval\u0026rsquo;s delivery of the Holy Grail to King Arthur, who is himself revived by its restorative waters, in John Boorman\u0026rsquo;s 1981 film Excalibur. Though not from the actual scene in the film, this live performance from the Nederlands Concertkoor while scenes from the film play is very moving, as is this HD Film Tribute version.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a whole different category of pairings, too, where the song is in direct opposition to the action, but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that for a future entry perhaps, except to say, A Clockwork Orange, and leave it to others to explore that rabbit hole.\nBlog 5/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"11 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-11/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Feed your head","type":"posts"},{"content":"Yesterday was a bit of a break, combining some technology and non-technology activities. Although, I suppose lighting is technology, as are books, but I digress.\nThere is a closet here in my office room that has AC power, but no installed lighting. Years ago, I purchased a set of Dioder LED lights from IKEA and used those to illuminate the space, but always in a very lazy way, draping the lights and cords hither and yon. It was finally time to address that. So, I used the supplied mounting brackets and installed the lights as they should have been installed long before now. What a change it made to the overall visibility of the space!\nAs I am no longer employed in higher ed and do not have ready access to the library and online resources that afforded me, it was time to remedy that also by finally getting a library card for my local library. The library is only a couple of minutes\u0026rsquo; walk from my home and I had confirmed earlier that it would be open given reductions in hours under COVID hours. The library itself is small, a single room in an older schoolhouse building that also houses an auditorium that, presumably, served as a gymnasium in its past. Despite the size, the few shelves contained quite a good selection of contemporary books and DVDs (!). The staff member was courteous and quickly processed my card application, while telling me of the various services now available to me with card in hand, including access to Overdrive for ebooks and audiobooks, Kanopy for streaming films and tv, Mango Languages for language learning, Universal Class for online classes, Wowbrary for notification of new acquisitions, and Gale Infotrac databases. Armed with my new card, I proceeded to borrow Isabel Wilkerson\u0026rsquo;s Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent, Leigh Bardugo\u0026rsquo;s YA fantasy heist Six of Crows, and the graphic novel Habibi, by Craig Thompson, and headed back home.\nBetween the IKEA lighting and the library, I did work for a bit on technology-related items. After years of sitting folded up quietly on a shelf, I decided to dust off my son\u0026rsquo;s old Epson Stylus Photo R280 printer. I expected most of the ink to be dry, but that turned out not to be the case. Every single tank was, however, just about empty. I cleaned the outside, connected it to my iMac, and installed the latest drivers. Powering it up, the printer instantly and unsurprisingly flashed its ink light at me. I pressed the button and was informed that yellow ink needed replacing. Thankfully, I had a spare box of cartridges and went to work. After loading the yellow tank, I opened the printer utility and clicked on the clean print heads button. After the usual whirring, the printer now informed me that all of the remaining color tanks needed replacing. That completed, I ran the print test page job and found lots of streaking, so I ran a combination of the clean print heads and test print jobs a few more times and things improved, though black continued to streak. I found an ink test print online and printed it out, confirming the black streaking but a few other issues as well. I went ahead and replaced the black tank, which improved things, but a few streaks remained even still. Turning to the internet for advice, as one does, I followed the direction to use a bit of alcohol on cotton swaps to clean the nozzles, and that seems to have done the trick. My plan is to identify some photos on my computer that are worth printing, pull out the box of fancy printer paper, and see what I can produce worth framing.\nThe other technology trip down memory lane landed me in retro gaming territory. I came across a note online about uses for an older tablet. I have an Amazon Fire HD 8 going to waste, so reading the article it suggested using it in the kitchen for recipes or for retro gaming. Cool! Let\u0026rsquo;s do both. So I proceeded to locate my collection of ripped ROMs from my own physical cartridges and read up a bit on RetroArch, the fronted tool for emulation. I plan to work on getting that setup today.\nBlog 4/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\n","date":"10 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-10/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"On lighting, libraries, inkjets, and retro gaming","type":"posts"},{"content":"The focus of yesterday was primarily around getting my blog up and running. I had written the first post already and wrote the second, but knew I needed to get them online.\nI decided that I wanted something simple and straightforward, and came across PHPetite by Bradley Taunt and liked the approach, having already been a fan of John Gruber and (RIP) Aaron Swartz\u0026rsquo;s Markdown for many years. So I started reading through the basic requirements, namely PHP 7.3. On my Mac I did a quick check and saw that I was only running 7.3, so there was work to do.\nI fired up iTerm2 and proceeded to use Homebrew to install PHP. Memory should have kicked in to remind me that it is never that easy, not the least of which because the current version of PHP is now v8.0, and PHP 7 will lose support in November 22. Homebrew finished doing its thing, but I still didn\u0026rsquo;t have things where they needed to be. A quick Google search led me to Casey McMullen\u0026rsquo;s article on Medium, \u0026ldquo;How to Install Apache on macOS 10.13 High Sierra and 10.14 Mojave using Homebrew.\u0026rdquo;. I followed the instructions in both parts 1 and 2, and almost had things working, but realized that my installation order was backward, which seemed to be affecting things. Once I reinstalled PHP, things were working. Yay!\nBack onto PHPetite, I grabbed the repo from Git and tried to run the build script for an out-of-the-box experience. That didn\u0026rsquo;t quite go as expected. Bash was not liking how Emanuil Rusev\u0026rsquo;s Parsedown was getting included, and I also realized I had probably not satisfied the requirements for PHP XML and PHP mbstring either, so I decided to give Bradley\u0026rsquo;s source of inspiration a go instead, Gregory Cadars\u0026rsquo; portable-php. This worked pretty much OOTB, including the Parsedown calls, which left me some time to get comfortable with the process and do just a little bit of customization to get to where we are now.\nWhich is where, exactly? Right, here on Neocities! But, how did I get here? I can\u0026rsquo;t even remember which Reddit pushed me down this particular rabbit hole, but from Bradley Taunt\u0026rsquo;s page I learned about the 1MB Club. There, I found Zenryeh\u0026rsquo;s page. His post, \u0026ldquo;On New Tools\u0026rdquo; is where I learned about Neocities. With tongue firmly in cheek, I decided \u0026ldquo;why not\u0026rdquo; and landed here.\nFor now, I\u0026rsquo;m editing posts with Markdown Pro1, saving them within the portable-php folder structure. Then generating the index.html page via the portable-php code. Saving that out to my local drive, and dragging the new index.html file up to my Neocities site. It is a bit convoluted at the moment, but the simplicity of of the output is what I like. It allows me to focus on the writing, too.\nBlog 3/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nI work mostly on a 2012 iMac running Mojave, so even though MarkDown Pro hasn\u0026rsquo;t been updated since 2014, it still works for now. I use other text editors as well, such as BBedit and TextMate. I\u0026rsquo;m flexible (or indecisive).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"9 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-09/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Getting the blog online","type":"posts"},{"content":"The plan for day 1 was to start setting up my collection of Raspberry Pi devices, both as a project just to put them to use, but also to serve as the basis for some Linux and development training/refreshing. I pulled out the collection, 2 x Pi 2B+, 1 x Pi 3B+, and 1 Pi 4, the newly purchased mini 5-port network switch, an Anker PowerPort 6 USB charging hub, an assortment of 12\u0026quot; ethernet cables and 12\u0026quot; microUSB cables1, and I began rummaging through my box of microSD cards and adapters.\nI started with the Pi 3 since I knew I had used it about six months ago. I booted it up to confirm the card inside was running RetroPie, which it was. I powered down, removed the card, and set it aside for safe keeping. I downloaded the Raspberry Pi Imager and set out to make my first card of the day. And, it failed.\nNext, I examined the microSD cards I had and popped one of the first I found into my iMac. I noted the familiar \u0026ldquo;boot\u0026rdquo; partition, noticed the file dates were also from about six months ago, so I unmounted it and slid it into the SD card slot of my newer Pi 2B, connected the various power, USB, and display cables, including my switched mouse and keyboard, and powered it up. It booted to a Buster desktop and I proceeded to run the necessary\nsudo apt-get update and\nsudo apt-get upgrade commands and let the debian environment do its thing.\nWhile that was running, I turned my attention to the next card I found, which turned out to be an old Android card. I ran the Raspberry Pi Imager application ready to burn the first of what I thought would be several cards for the day. Instead, I received an error. So I then tried balenaEtcher, but I needed to download the latest Raspberry Pi OS image file, which also took some time. Remembering that the Pi 2B is not particularly peppy, I also downloaded the Raspberry Pi OS Lite version of the Pi image as well. Yet, Etcher also failed, so I tried Disk Utility, which also failed. No matter what I attempted, the existing content refused to be overwritten. I was able to remove most of the files, but nearly 3GB of the data simply refused to go away. Then, I was starting to have vague memories of this happening before.\nI booted up my Windows 10 machine to give its tools a try. I tried Windows Disk Management. I tried Diskpart. I ran chkdsk. I tried different SD card adapters. I tried a microSD card reader. I toggled the write-protect switch on the adapters. I tried just about everything short of downloading a third-party tool. Nothing was successful. I even went back to the Mac and tried a few more tools there, all with no luck.\nIn the meantime, the Raspian Lite image completed, and I located another card, which I was able to successfully image with Etcher. I spent the next hour or so getting the second Pi 2B up and running, updated, and installed Pi-Hole on it. I then worked on both of the Pi 2Bs to get them a little more secure, and accessible via SSH and, for one, VNC.\nDuring my Etcher runs I noticed their advertisement for balenaSound, an image to use a Raspberry Pi as a multi-platform streaming audio device, and decided to download it to test on one of the Pis. I located another SD card, one that clearly had been in a Raspberry Pi before, and set about to etching it. Only, it too failed. Lather, rinse, repeat the efforts from the morning. This card refused to give up its partitions or be reformatted.\nIn frustration, I needed a diversion, so I decided it was time to pull out the Edifier shelf speakers and get them set up in my office space anyway. I connected them to my Echo Dot, and filled the room with music. I also tidied up the office a bit as well.\nToward the end of the day, I had my first meeting with a career coach who had been recommended to me by a friend. Janice Jaguszewski and I had a great conversation. Originally scheduled for an hour, we spoke for nearly 90 minutes. We learned we had a lot in common and she encouraged me in saying that I was much further along the path than many people with whom she\u0026rsquo;s worked. She reminded me of a few options I can begin to pursue as I explore some alternatives for the road ahead.\nFinally, just after dinner time, UPS delivered my new iPad Pro 11, so I spent most of the rest of the evening, getting it set up for use and installing the software that I felt would be essential. I also went online and ordered a cover, screen protector, fake Apple pencil, oh, and that 12\u0026quot; USB-C cable referenced in the footnote.\nBlog 2/100 #100DaysToOffLoad\nYes, I know the Pi 4 will need a USB-C cable\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"8 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2021-09-08/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"It's never what you expect","type":"posts"},{"content":"As of Saturday, I am officially and voluntarily unemployed, having left my previous employer after 18 months and 1 day.

If you have, I’m curious which wagon you’re on? I’ve probably been optimistic about badging for 2-3 years now, ever since hearing about badging at an ELI Conference.\nSo far, though, we’ve only had one real wagon pull out this station, but it was a good one and it was connected to a campus course. Instructional Designer Mike Goudzwaard worked with Professor Michael Evans on an interdisciplinary course on “Science and Religion in America.” They developed several badges to track students’ progress through a set of digital scholarship skills. The decision to use badges, in addition to grades, was guided by a desire to communicate student competency beyond the grades alone.\nHere in the Jones Media Center, my staff worked with the Prof. Evans to develop a badge sequence for learning to use the Mediathread platform created by Columbia University. The badging outcomes ranged from “attend a training” to “create a Mediathread project based on training.” You can read more about the course and badging in Joshua Kim’s interview with Michael and Mike for the Inside Higher Ed blog. https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/course-badging-case-study\nWhile that is certainly the first badge program we’ve worked on, I hope it’s not the last. I’ve wanted us to develop badging for other courses, too, but the challenge, I believe, is that it needs to permeate the course to be meaningful, in the way the Prof. Evans used badging throughout his course. We are always trying to develop the skills of students as they complete multimedia/multimodal assignments. This involves, in particular, camera skills, audio recording skills, editing skills and storytelling skills. I’m hoping that we can put together a package of multimedia badges that we can offer to faculty who are ready to employ badging in their courses. While I’m not 100% sold on badges, I do think it is important to have a way to recognize the skills students learn in a given course, and badging provides more information than does a letter grade on a transcript.\nBut, I’m also trying to implement badging as part of our student training process, too. Whether student work for us essentially as circulation assistants or as technical assistants, defining a series of proficiencies that they can, ultimately, leave with, should not only make it easier for them to describe what they have done while working for us, but also make it easy for us to more reliably describe their accomplishments when we get contacted as a reference. I think badging also offers possibilities for opening up higher-end professional grade media equipment to our students—complete a badging sequence, receive badge, show us the badge on your LinkedIn page and now the (gimbal, jib, drone, dolly, DSLR) is available to you to borrow.\nWhat about you? Is your media center badging as part of your instructional design work or for your student employee program? What challenges are you facing? I’d welcome your thoughts.\n","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2015-08-04-badging-in-the-media-center/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Badging in the Media Center","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/course-media/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Course-Media","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/edtech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Edtech","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/instructional-design/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Instructional-Design","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/media/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Media","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/mediamixed/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"MediaMixEd","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"4 August 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/musings/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Musings","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/books/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/education/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Education","type":"tags"},{"content":"It has been far too long since I added a new post. Life just sort of gets in the way sometimes. But, I was inspired to post again.\nHaving just completed Andy Weir\u0026rsquo;s The Martian, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about media, technology and applications of both to educational technology. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already read Weir\u0026rsquo;s debut novel, a highly enjoyable survival story of an astronaut, Mark Watney, left behind on Mars when his crewmates suddenly are forced to flee the planet, I strongly recommend it. It reads like a longer version of the Apollo 13 mission. Remember the scene in the film adaptation where a guy shows up with a cardboard box of parts that look like an auto mechanic\u0026rsquo;s yard sale and says, \u0026ldquo;I think we can save them\u0026rdquo;? The Martian is like that for nearly its entire length.\n\u0026ldquo;The Martian 2014.\u0026rdquo; Licensed under Fair use via Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Martian_2014.jpg#/media/File:The_Martian_2014.jpg\\\nWhat does that have to do with educational technology you ask? As a classic survivor tale, the book is about all of the following (yes, there\u0026rsquo;s overlap, but bear with me):\nResource Constraints: Mark Watney is constantly analyzing what he has in terms of resources and how to make the most of those resources. Most of us working in educational technology often feel constraints on our resources: dollars, equipment, space, time, etc. Like Watney, we’re regularly challenged to make the most of what we have. Of course, while our livelihood depends on it, our lives do not. Tools: when is a hammer not a hammer? When it can be sharpened into a stake. That\u0026rsquo;s not in the book, but our fearless astronaut is always rethinking how to use or repurpose his toolset (see Resource Constraints above). I recall a story I read many years ago when Microsoft brought Office users in for a focus group and the engineers were flummoxed to discover that users rarely used the tools they, the software engineers, developed in the way they expected the users to do so. Some of the most successful applications of educational technologies occur when people realize that a tool can be used in completely new ways. Optimism: Throughout Watney\u0026rsquo;s ordeal, he never loses his sense of optimism. He knows his decisions mean life or death, which perhaps helps, but he never completely gives in to the despair that would likely cost him his life and he seems content to \u0026ldquo;die trying.\u0026rdquo; Optimism drives us to keep trying new things. Very few of us (I hope) have simply thrown up our hands and said, “Alright, then, keep your chalk and your slate tablets and go back to your lecture”! Humor: Hand in hand with the optimism, Watney never loses his sense of humor. Most of the story is told through journal entries. He realizes he may die, but if he does, he wants others to know how he lived (and possibly died). While he doesn\u0026rsquo;t sugarcoat his situation, he also doesn\u0026rsquo;t dehumanize the entries by recording \u0026ldquo;just the facts, ma\u0026rsquo;am.\u0026rdquo; The colleagues I’ve met in the ed-tech field are some of the funniest/craziest/silliest folks I know. I think this goes hand-in-hand with the optimism above. Throwing out what you don\u0026rsquo;t need: on several occasions, Watney\u0026rsquo;s survivability depends on throwing out what isn\u0026rsquo;t essential to the task at hand. He realizes there is risk in doing so, but sometimes he simply has to focus on the primary goal and everything else is non-essential. This is probably our biggest challenge, less so, perhaps, for ourselves, but more so in our work with faculty. Convincing faculty to strive for greater student understanding even it it means sacrificing content coverage is a good example. Old technology: Watney\u0026rsquo;s enough of a voyager to know how to navigate by the stars, even when the stars (and the length of the day) are different when experienced on Mars. Still, at one point he fashions a makeshift sextent to navigate across the Martian landscape. I’m not advocating that we cling to old technology, but we certainly need to understand what makes/made older technology successful and, where appropriate, make sure we don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Not only that, but sometimes the old technology becomes a great “plan B” lifesaver. New technology: Of course, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be on Mars in the first place if it weren\u0026rsquo;t due to new technologies\u0026ndash;nearly all of it designed to save the lives of astronauts. I’ve often repeated the line that, in higher ed, “nobody ever dies in a computer crash.” Thankfully, that is true for us. Nevertheless, as educational technology professionals, this is (a large part of) our lives. While we are the ones who often introduce new technologies to our campus, we must be equally responsive to new technologies arriving on our campus brought by students, faculty and other staff. We are constantly walking the line between being reactive and proactive. Unlike the tech for our astronaut hero, not all of the technology that comes our way is there to help us. Applied knowledge to new situations: however, it is Watney\u0026rsquo;s ability to combine knowledge of both old and new technology that improves his chances to survive. This is the meat and potatoes of our profession\u0026ndash;how do we take what we know about teaching and learning and apply new technology to create more successful solutions. We constantly remind ourselves, and our faculty, that it isn’t the technology, but the teaching and learning that counts. For better or worse, though, any campus that doesn’t embrace a certain level of technology is likely to find itself out of business or in an increasingly narrow niche market. Perseverance: Watney never gives up, not just on his mission to survive, but even on his mission as an astronaut, collecting and labeling rock samples during his trans-Martian journey even if he is unable to deliver them back to earth. I hope that, like our Martian explorer protagonist, you wake up each day with the same desire to push onward with the mission to improve the teaching and learning experience on your campus, leaving enough of a record for others to learn from what you’ve done that has succeeded and what hasn’t. Collaboration: Not to spoil the book, but Watney doesn\u0026rsquo;t just MacGyver a new spaceship and send himself home. Everything leading up to the book\u0026rsquo;s conclusion is a combination of Watney\u0026rsquo;s own efforts and ingenuity, along with what is probably the single most expensive rescue attempt operation the Earth has ever seen. Collaboration will make or break the outcome. That is certainly true for us. Our positions are essentially defined as collaborative at the outset, and our success depends on multiple collaborations within our institutions. What about you? Have you read The Martian? In what other ways does your job seems like a survivor story? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.\nAs sort of a postscript, there are two other media-related themes that were harder to connect to our profession, but wanted to add nonetheless:\nFondness for old media: I think it suffices to say that old media, in particular TV and music from the 1970s, is a recurring theme in “The Martian.” In fact, except for the location and some newer contemporary references, this novel embraces the 1970s in many ways. Media obsession with crisis: though downplayed in terms of text and page time, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a contemporary tale without mentioning the Earth-based media attention Watney\u0026rsquo;s survival and rescue attempt tale garnishes, with a daily show on CNN to update viewers on the latest events. Even that is reminiscent of the media attention paid to the Iran hostage situation of 1979-81, with nightly updates throughout the 444-day ordeal.

Drop dumplings a few at a time into simmering broth. (If you boil them too high, the dumplings will disappear or clump together.) Let cook about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the dumplings and chicken from sticking to bottom of pan. Add the poultry seasoning and then salt and pepper to taste. Optionally: Add a few drops of yellow food coloring if you want the broth and dumplings to have a slight yellow tint. (Usually if you cook chicken with skin on it makes the broth yellow and give it a better flavor. You can remove the skin after cooking.) When done, remove pan from heat and let rest about 10 minutes. Granny said sometimes she would add a little milk like a ⅓ cup after they were done. I have done it with and without. It’s fine either way. Note: I don\u0026rsquo;t like my broth to be too soupy once the dumplings are added but I don\u0026rsquo;t like it real thick either so I usually add a can of chicken broth. It also depends on how much you lose during the process of cooking the chicken. Experiment. Have fun. If you only have skinless chicken on hand, the broth wont have as much flavor. As a solution, just add a can of Healthy Request Campbell\u0026rsquo;s Cream of Chicken soup and it will fix the problem.

At the end, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t stay tuned until the lights come up or the commercial break begins, the credits roll, listing all the people who have helped bring that experience to the audience.\nCourses, too, offer an experience over a period of time and are rarely prepared and delivered wholly through the efforts of one person. Why then do courses not include credits? After all, for many people outside of higher ed, there is often a lack of understanding about what is actually involved in teaching today. More importantly there is a lack of understanding about how many people are involved in “producing” a course.\nYes, I realize that unions are primarily responsible for making sure everyone is credited in an entertainment industry production. But, when someone asks why a blockbuster film costs so much, it is pretty easy to point to the credits to show all the people that needed to be paid in order to bring that film to the screen.\nBut for courses, other than the professor, what about acknowledging the librarians, the library staff, the instructional designers, the LMS administrators, and others who have played some direct role in helping to deliver that course?\nJust about the only time anyone seems to publicly acknowledge the various people who indirectly contribute to the education a person receives is when a class valedictorians has their brief moment at the podium to thank “all the teachers and administrators” for helping get them where they are. But let’s face it, that’s like the opening credits of season one of “Gilligan’s Island,” in which the Professor and Mary Ann are reduced to “\u0026hellip;and the rest.”\nThis isn’t about ego, it’s about recognition. Students earn course credit. Faculty are credited as course owners. Maybe it’s high time for giving credit where credit is long overdue.\nOf course, the tricky part may be figuring out whom to include and where exactly to let these particular credits roll.\n","date":"13 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2014-01-13-a-different-kind-of-course-credit/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A Different Kind of Course Credit","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/courses/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Courses","type":"tags"},{"content":"I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty much over zombies. I mean, I’ll still continue to watch The Walking Dead, because it remains a pretty compelling television show, but for me, zombies (and vampires!) have pretty much run their current course, with two notable exceptions.\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_311\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"273\"\\] Not your average flesh-eating monsters.\n\\[/caption\\]The first is BBC’s In the Flesh, which aired last summer. It is a post-zombie show, both figuratively and literally. The zombie uprising is over and now those affected by the illness, who have not already been put down permanently, are back among the living, survivors with PDS (Partially Deceased Syndrome) who must check in with social workers and maintain a medication regimen to keep the illness in check. But both the normal humans and the PDS zombies must still deal with the memories and knowledge of the atrocities that followed the outbreak, and must work out how to live together once again. While the show walks a familiar path of allegory for contemporary social and domestic issues, as well as the older topic of “otherness,” it changes the whole zombie dynamic. The typical zombie carnage is largely in the past, and the violence that remains, both physical and emotional, is perpetrated almost wholly by the living. I know that BBC intends to create a second season, and the 3-night mini-series certainly left a number of issues unresolved. At the same time, I’m not sure that there is enough to sustain a longer show. It would be sadly ironic for the show to become afflicted with its own form of PDS.\nThe second series, on the other hand, has much more storytelling to do. I’ve just binged through the first 13-episodes of the Japanese animated series Attack on Titan and I have not been so caught up in a show in quite a while. Part of it is the pacing (time flies!) and how each episode seems to end with a cliffhanger that compels you watch just one more episode. Titan is that guy at the costume party that spent two years preparing a costume, just in case. It is a zombie show unlike any other. The “zombies” here are certainly mindless man-eaters, but they are not really zombies in the sense of being the risen undead. Here, they are the titans of the title. They are giant (3m-15m tall), asexual, human-like creatures who roam the earth consuming people. In the first season, we learn that they showed up over 100 years prior and nearly wiped out all of humanity, but we still don’t know where they’ve come from. The humans responded by building and withdrawing to a multi-walled nation-state and a peaceful existence has persisted for nearly a century. In episode 1, new titan variants appear on the scene and breach the outermost wall, opening up a new era of bloodshed. Our primary characters begin as young teens who soon find themselves volunteering to train as warriors in the Survey Corps branch of the military, to serve the nation at the front in the ongoing battle against the titans. I’m oversimplifying so as not to give too much away, but Attack on Titan is one of the darkest, most gut-wrenching, and brutal animated shows that I’ve watched. But, it is also a bright, action-packed, incredibly well-done adventure series that is compelling to watch. There is also plenty of mystery remaining as humanity learns more about this enemy and how to survive against it. I’ve already started on the next 13 episodes. \\[Did I mention it has been a huge commercial success as well, with sales of the original 12-book manga series reaching over 28 million volumes?\\]I know that Japanese anime is not everyone’s cup of tea, and I’m not sure that Attack on Titan is likely to change your mind. However, if you are a fan of the zombie genre but are looking for something fresh and new, I strongly recommend it. If you prefer flesh-and-blood actors, maybe In the Flesh is more your cup of zombie brew.\nIn the Flesh is available on DVD now and Attack on Titan is available to watch free on Funimation\u0026rsquo;s web site (http://www.funimation.com/shows/attack-on-titan/anime) or on CrunchyRoll (http://www.crunchyroll.com), with DVDs releasing later this year.\n","date":"8 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2014-01-08-a-new-kind-of-zombie/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"A New Kind of Zombie","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/anime/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Anime","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bbc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"BBC","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/zombie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zombie","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 January 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/zombies/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zombies","type":"tags"},{"content":"Yield: 4 dinner servings, 6 appetizer servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 small yellow onion, diced 1 small red onion, diced 5 cloves of garlic, peeled 2 medium gold potatoes, scrubbed, diced 1/2 Japanese pumpkin, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks 2 large carrots, scrubbed, chopped 2 parsnips, peeled, chopped 1 fennel bulb, chopped 1/2 head chopped cauliflower pieces 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 2 teaspoons dried thyme Sea salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste 1 quart of organic vegetable broth 2 14oz. cans of diced or stewed tomatoes PREPARATION\nPreheat oven to 400ºF.

This is my third attempt to finish a course, and with each one I make a little more progress. This time, in particular, I put a little skin in the game\u0026ndash;I signed up and paid for the certified level of the course. If you are not familiar with Coursera’s Signature Track it involves a system for trying to verify the work that you submit is actually yours. Every time I attempt a homework quiz, this system asks me to check a box stating that the work is mine. It then lights up my computer’s built-in camera to take a picture in order to confirm me visually. Finally, I am asked to type a statement certifying the work is my own, and my keystrokes are used to “fingerprint” my typing style.\nOverall, it’s not a bad system, though I recognize how it possibly could be exploited. More importantly, though, is how things can go a bit wrong for a valid and earnest “student,” such as myself.\nUp until two weeks ago, the course has been going well. That’s when my travels began-a week of vacation and then a conference. The night before leaving (a Friday night), I scrambled to finish the work that was due by the following Tuesday. Then, when I next had network connectivity, I downloaded all the videos for the next lesson, not knowing when I might have another connection. \\[Note: This was a great relief, and a great help for students who may not have persistent Internet access.\\] My intentions were good, but traveling being what it is, I was not able to finish watching all the videos on my regular timeline.\nOne trip finished, but another was about the begin, and now I was a week behind. I was relieved to discover, however, that the Tuesday deadline for homework submission had now been extended to Saturday. I proceeded to download the new videos and committed to catching up during my second trip. Coincidentally, I also decided to travel lighter, taking only my iPad and Bluetooth keyboard, instead of a full laptop.\nEach night I watched videos, made notes, read related materials and completed ungraded mini quizzes. By Thursday night, I was ready to complete the graded homework and then it hit me. Could I complete the Signature Track requirements with the iPad? It has a camera and a keyboard, but…it doesn’t do (Adobe) Flash! Sure enough, there was the tech note on the Coursera site confirming that the Signature Track is not currently supported on mobile devices.\nI was prepared to borrow a laptop from another conference attendee but thankfully the hotel provided the solution I needed. The “business center” not only had computers, more importantly it had contemporary desktops with built-in webcams! Yay! I completed my assignment and successfully submitted my work.\nLesson learned. Read the fine print. MOOCs may not yet be fully “mobilized” even if most of content is readily accessible.

I want to thank her for getting me to write again.\\]About 17 months ago I joined a new community, one that I had only ever imagined myself joining about a dozen times before. But the entrance was barred, I believed, by the lack of a degree. Specifically, I became a part of the library community, and I did it without an MLIS degree. Much to my surprise, I was not alone, though I still refrain from calling myself a “librarian.” Librarians, after all, have earned the title through years of study, practice and/or a combination of both. Nevertheless, I was welcomed to the community and am quite happy to be here. Of course, it helped that the library staff and administration here at Dartmouth College Library made my transition a smooth one. no-pain Before I go into how they managed that, allow me to provide a little background. I have been bouncing, albeit slowly, between technology positions (computers, multimedia) and teaching positions (Japanese, English, technology) for a number of years, ultimately bringing the two together as an academic technologist. I came to Dartmouth four years ago to head up the Arts \u0026amp; Humanities Resource Center (AHRC), which provided technology and teaching support to A\u0026amp;H faculty. During the economic crisis of the past few years, Dartmouth saw a lot of reorganization and the AHRC as it existed was no more. I applied for and was hired as the Head of Digital Media and Library Technologies in the spring of 2011. That’s how I joined one of the biggest organizations on campus, with close to 150 staff members and probably the largest population of student employees, too. Despite having heard some rumors about the library community here from friends who work there, I still didn’t know what to expect. I have since learned that our library takes “community” very seriously. Here are some of the things we do to promote that:\nOrientation Two or three times a year we run new employees through a library orientation process. Over the course of six weeks, the group spends up to an hour in each of the library’s departments (e.g. cataloging/metadata, acquisitions, interlibrary loan) and affiliate locations (e.g. special collections library, biomedical library, storage library), getting to know the staff in each location as well as gaining an understanding of the work done there and the role that department plays in the overall library organization. The orientation begins and ends with sessions with library administration. While the immediate benefits seem obvious, there is an additional benefit, too. The group of new hires is itself comprised of staff from around the library, which helps you make personal connections beyond your own department.\nCandidate Presentations and Hiring As you may expect, we do a fair amount of hiring throughout the library. For all professional positions, the candidates are expected to do a presentation. What is unusual is that the presentations are open to the entire library staff. Having gone through the experience myself, you can imagine the surprise on candidate’s faces when they have an audience of 50 people. What’s more, all staff members are invited to weigh in on the candidates through an open online feedback form. You may be a library programmer, but your opinion of the biomedical librarian candidate is just as valued. We’ve talked to candidates who have commented that the audience for the presentation was not only memorable in comparison to other interviews, but also that the diverse audience sent a strong message of library community. Oh, and once hired, there is almost always a welcoming event that is open to all staff.\nAll-Staff Meetings Twice a year we have all-staff meetings. But if everyone’s in a meeting, who’s taking care of the Library? On all-staff meeting days, the program is run twice, with a morning session and an afternoon session. This allows staff to come at a time that is most convenient, while still keeping our service desks open. The meetings usually begin with introduction of new staff (sensing a theme here?) before launching into programs that are designed to inform the community of projects or changes, and may also include invited guests from other parts of campus. One all-staff meeting also becomes our annual “Inspiring Ideas Conference.” After opening comments and introductions, a keynote session is followed by break-out sessions where staff present to other staff on activities, tools, and services provided throughout the library. Past sessions have included coping with collection disasters (work, home, community), personal finance tools available through library resources, an insider’s look at the University Press of New England (UPNE), and hardware and software available for personal use through the media center.\nDCLSA Our organization also maintains a social support group known as the Dartmouth College Library Staff Association. You can see on the DCLSA home page that the purpose of the group is three-fold:\nPromote communication and cooperation among staff in the library through membership and participation in the DCLSA; Provide a scholarship fund that offers members partial tuition reimbursement for continuing education courses or programs; Promote staff morale and social relationships by welcoming new staff, administering staff welfare funds and sponsoring social or educational events The events throughout the year are well-attended.\nTaken altogether, I honestly can say that there is not another department or organization on campus that I’d rather be a part of. I’m glad to be a staff member of the library, and I do feel the initiation pain level was just about zero, without even a spoonful of sugar.\n\\[P.S. I don't advise searching Google for images with the terms \"no pain\" or variations thereof.\\]","date":"4 September 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2012-09-04-initiation-pain-level-zero/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Initiation Pain Level Zero","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 September 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/libraries/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Libraries","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ebooks/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ebooks","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/epub/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Epub","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/epublishing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Epublishing","type":"tags"},{"content":"Reading books on an portable electronic device is nothing new to me. I’ve been doing it for probably 15 years or so, going back to Peanut Press titles on my Palm Pilot. My experience with interactive fiction goes back even further. And yet, I still have never been fully sold on eBooks, eMagazines and the like. But, I may finally be coming around to it, but only by changing my way of thinking, and watching as, hopefully, the publishing industry starts to change as well. Epub Logo The problem for me has been, I believe, that ePublishing has primarily focused on “how do we make books digital?” rather than “how do we publish effectively in the digital age?”\nI’m still a huge fan of “dead tree” editions of both books and magazines. While I have cut back on both my subscriptions and the number of books that I buy, I have not moved those dollars to digital editions. For the most part, I’m not interested in simply having an “e-text” edition. While the digital version offers some convenience for portability and for storage, I’m giving up too much of what I enjoy about the physical thing.\nHowever, more and more I find myself reading the paper magazines that I subscribe to and wishing for them to be more interactive. I confess, I’m not talking about The New Yorker or The Economist, though I’m sure they could benefit from some interactivity as well. My subscriptions include PC Gamer, Wired, and Popular Science. These publications now regularly include interactive elements, usually in the form of web links, but this requires me to fire up my laptop/iPad/or desktop and then my browser, magazine in hand. A digital version would take me right to the link or, better yet, embed the content right on the digital page. A few months after I read them, many of the news and opinion pieces of these magazines lose their value to me. I would throw out my back issues but for another feature that keeps them on my shelf\u0026ndash;the DIY stories, the machinima video links, the coverage of game mods and free indie games. These aspects outlive the usefulness of much of the rest of the magazine. And frankly, it is just too much work to cull through the list of links and make my own reference guide, or even to rip out the pages that I want and scan them into my PDF library.\nSo, really, what I’m after is the best of both worlds. I want the paper edition that can live in my bathroom “reading basket,” as well as the enriched digital edition. But I’m selfish, and cheap. Don’t make me pay twice for the same subscription. Give me a blended price, not unlike the old model of a paper subscription with the disc stuck to the cover.\n","date":"15 August 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2012-08-15-rethinking-ebooks-or-selling-myself-on-e-publishing-part-1/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Rethinking eBooks, or Selling Myself on e-Publishing (Part 1)","type":"posts"},{"content":"\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_257\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"Click to Listen to the podcast\"\\] MediaMixED Podcast \\[/caption\\]This episode is almost all about television!

At issue is the shift from a \u0026ldquo;wholesale model\u0026rdquo; to an \u0026ldquo;agency model\u0026rdquo; and Apple\u0026rsquo;s insistence that an ebook could not be sold for less by rival retailers. The deal gave Apple its 30% and kept prices high for publishers, who then imposed the model on other ebook sellers, most notably Amazon. Rights Eraser While I\u0026rsquo;m glad this has caught the attention of the DOJ, I\u0026rsquo;m still less than pleased that ebooks are essentially sold to consumers under a \u0026ldquo;license\u0026rdquo; agreement model, which undermines the first-sale doctrine and prevents the sharing, trading, and reselling of text that would apply to physical books. Once again, it seems that consumers are getting the raw end of the deal. The software industry began taking away consumer protections with the nefarious \u0026ldquo;click-through\u0026rdquo; agreements.

In particular, she appears to be repudiating team-based approaches to work and education for everyone on the grounds that it doesn’t work well for introverts. In fact she spends nearly 20 paragraphs writing against the benefits of teams before offering “a more nuanced approach to creativity and learning.”\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_244\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" caption=\"\"LED light bulb\" by Karl Baron. Used under a CC-BY-2.0 license. Click for link to original.\"\\] LED light bulb \\[/caption\\]I will agree with Cain that many fine ideas come from individuals working alone, but so do outlandish, hare-brained ideas that can never fly. Steve Wozniak is a brilliant man whom I respect greatly, but there is every possibility that, without the charisma of Steve Jobs and, ultimately, the efforts of everyone who brought Apple computers to the marketplace (yes, I know the longer version of the story, with Steve and Steve building their earliest shipments in the garage), Wozniak’s work would have remained exclusively in the hands of homebrew enthusiasts the world over. After all, not everyone is a genius, (and not everyone has the charisma of Steve Jobs), but not all the ideas from the smartest minds are good ones. In fact, many bright, successful people will tell you of their failures along the way.\nMore importantly, though, great ideas are also born of “happy collisions” and can be nourished to reality among groups. A librarian friend of mine has just penned an article on “Collision Spaces” and the benefits of serendipitous meetings and chance encounters, lost when architectural design favors more private offices and fewer group spaces. While I count myself lucky to have a private space in which to work, I do spend a lot of time in meetings, both formal and informal (do not underestimate the benefits of an impromptu hallway gathering!). The “group” represented by the attendees of those meetings, however, knows far more together than I know as an individual. Most people would not call me an introvert, though, so I am not afraid to voice my opinions and ideas in those meetings, and welcome the feedback from others to tell me why I’m wrong, why I may be insufficiently informed, or why my thoughts are valued. The groups that I have the pleasure of working with, for the most part, help me to improve and give shape to my ideas so that they have a better chance of succeeding when they are realized.\nI do not disagree that more and more time during the workday is spent in meetings, and not all of it is productive. Nor do I disagree that many of us need time away, in the nooks and crannies or in our own offices, to be more productive. I think that’s true for introverts and extroverts alike.\nFor me, though, Cain’s attempt to brand “Groupthink” as some new form of socialistic threat to our communities is just misguided. It is not about conformity in classroom pods, it is about the exchange of ideas in those pods, the sharing of knowledge, the strong helping the weak, and about learning how to work with others. For better or worse, these are skills that the modern worker, and the modern society, needs. While it is not a given, we CAN be brighter together.\n","date":"26 January 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2012-01-26-brighter-together/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Brighter Together","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 January 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gaming/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gaming","type":"tags"},{"content":"Sebastian Deterding\u0026rsquo;s Google Tech Talk on \u0026ldquo;Meaningful Play: Getting Gamification Right\u0026rdquo; addresses the success of web sites such as Foursquare, GetGlue, Nike+, and Badgeville.

If we are going to cut the cord, it appears as though we will have to shave it off piece by piece.\nI share a lot of Castillo\u0026rsquo;s frustrations (remotes and cables included). Last summer I intended to cut the cord at home, only to bail when two other issues arose. The first was Comcast\u0026rsquo;s decision to offer a new suite of alternative programming packages (the MyTV Choice bundles) in my area, which allowed me to scale back the number of channels in my cable lineup and save some money along with it. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite a la cart yet, but certainly a step in the right direction. The \u0026ldquo;Get Started Plus\u0026rdquo; bundle comes close to an 80/20 solution. The second was that I then turned around and used the cost savings to buy monthly access to JapanTV, an overpriced, single-channel offering of news and entertainment programming from Japan. This has long been a request from my wife and the opportunity finally presented itself.\nSo, we still have been unable to cut the cord. Much is available freely online and through other services, such as Netflix and Hulu, but content and timeliness matter. Netflix\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;contemporary\u0026rdquo; streaming offerings still feel anemic, many DVDs are delayed a month, and Hulu is delaying many new shows by a week at the request of studios and networks. While there is an abundant supply of people willing to post recordings on YouTube and a plethora of similar international services, one usually needs to watch quickly before the content owners file their takedown notices. I purposely avoid the torrent market these days, leaving few alternatives to watch content when and where I want it, unless I keep the cable connected and take advantage of the OnDemand service that that provides.\nStill, that leaves me waiting until 2012 to watch HBO\u0026rsquo;s adaptation of Game of Thrones, when the DVD set will be released and I can borrow it from my library.\nThe cord is still tough to cut.\n","date":"12 December 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-12-12-still-not-a-cord-cutter/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Still Not a Cord-Cutter","type":"posts"},{"content":"Seems a bit quaint to start a podcast here in 2011, but this is some three years in the making.

Describing our modern world of medical advances, wireless communication, miniaturization, etc. to people 100 or 200 hundred years ago, the future would have seemed as far-fetched, magical or blasphemous (depending on your POV) as some of the videos are today. We can only envision the future through the lens of our present understanding of the world, which is why I think these visions tread into the uncanny valley (familiar yet foreign).\nCarr may be repelled by the packaging of these visions, but I view the packaging in the same way I view most TV shows that feature perfect people living fantasy lives\u0026ndash;as fantasies. However, I DO like to imagine the various applications of technology that I see in these videos. For me, my criticism or cynicism is not about the packaging, but about the degree to which commercial/government interests, or even valid security/privacy concerns, will prevent these visions from becoming a reality.\nWhat do you think? Are the videos cold or sterile? Too minimalistic? Too fantastic?\n-\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;\nI blogged about Corning’s video a couple of months ago.\nMicrosoft has a series of these videos, including the first one below that Carr references:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0\n\\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0\\]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYCez_DoHpo\n\\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYCez\\_DoHpo\\]Here’s a vision of screens, with some elements that we see other places, too.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-_eVzxDXB0\n\\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-\\_eVzxDXB0\\]","date":"30 October 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-10-30-uncomfortable-utopias/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Uncomfortable Utopias?","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 October 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/utopia/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Utopia","type":"tags"},{"content":"Another EDUCAUSE Conference has come and gone. This year was my first time back since 2008, but I must admit that I think this was one of the best I’ve attended. I believe it was a combination of factors that contributed to this. On the one hand, the economic malaise of the past several years has begun to lift so the mood itself was better. The session mix, too, was a good one (Thank you, Program Committee). For me, that means that there weren’t too many overlapping sessions and I actually had time to explore the vendor floor. Or maybe I was just lucky in that, with my new position in the library, I was able to choose a schedule that met my interest while still allowing me time to look around the show floor. Either way, I feel that the overall conference was a successful one for me professionally.\nSome notes:\nThe opening keynote by Seth Godin was well-done from a presentation point of view. As a professional speaker, Godin was clearly “off book” and knew his material well. His slides were interesting visually and his message was one that I believe many in the audience were pleased to hear. I must agree with my colleague, Josh Kim, however, who faults Godin for not doing a bit more homework to connect the message more closely to the educationally-oriented audience. One could easily imagine Godin giving the same presentation at any number of other conferences with little effort beyond some drag-and-drop changes. During the Q\u0026amp;A session, an audience member asked Godin for his solution to the educational challenges our nation faces. While acknowledging that the issue is more complex than anything that he could suggest, his response was that we should send our children to public school during the school day, to participate in and support the community, and home-school our children the rest of the day, using every opportunity parents have to encourage their intellectual development. While a good answer, I think it lacked the inspirational insight many may have hoped for following the main presentation.\nThe Vendor Floor was big and nicely laid out. I appreciated the wide walking corridors. My memory of past events was more cramped. The only place where space was at a premium was in the area that was designated for poster sessions. New this year was Startup Alley, a place for up-and-coming ventures to pitch their wares. The company that caught my eye was Kno, a web and mobile app for e-textbooks. Kno offers over 100,000 textbook titles and supports PDFs as well. On an iPad, Kno then adds a number of tools for annotation, note taking, for 3D modeling of chemical structures. The texts can be purchased or rented. The notes can be read within the context of the page or can be read as a companion notebook format, with direct links back to the source page. Plus, the notes live in the Cloud so that they are accessible between devices, too.\nOther notes from the floor:\nI enjoyed Google’s booth setup, which combined an “indoor” product area along with an “outdoor” fireside chat area for their demo workshops, complete with forest imagery and outdoor carpet. They gave away Chrome-based notebook computers at each workshop. The MoodleRooms exhibit was quite large, a testament to how many schools have chosen to move away from commercial LMS vendors. I was pleasantly surprised by Epson’s interactive short throw projectors, with both wall and table mounts. The latter allows for interactive tabletop collaboration without the investment in something like Microsoft’s Surface computer. iPads were everywhere throughout the Conference, in attendees hands and as top prizes in vendor raffle drawings. In addition to corporate products on the show floor, it was nice to see other projects continuing to be developed at colleges and universities. BiblioBouts is an online game developed at the University of Michigan to help students learn the process of finding high quality information using library databases and other reference information. At the end of the game, students will have a high quality bibliography or list of research sources they can use for to complete the course assignment, as well as research skills they can continue to use throughout their college coursework.\nPurdue returned to demo their Hotseat product, a backchannel aggregator to assist students with question and answer in a large classroom setting. It joins a bevy of tools on their Studio Projects page, which includes Jetpack (for interactive learning), Doubletake (for video assignments), Mixable (making academics social) and Signals (an early intervention tool).\nUCLA showed off and demonstrated their MWF (mobile web framework), a Javascript and CSS framework designed to make developing for mobile devices as easy as possible. Their guiding principles behind the framework are:\nDevice Agnostic - The framework is compatible with any web-capable mobile device. Platform Independent - The framework can be used by applications written in any language and on any environment. Easy to Use - Developers write one set of semantic markup and the framework handles the rest. Easy to Deploy - The framework is lightweight and simple to deploy and maintain. The platform is already in use on five UC campuses and three more are in development. There is an active community around the framework and they have hosted annual conferences and workshops. The demo was amazingly easy to follow and looked very easy to implement.\nSpencer Striker began developing GameZombieTV as part of his Master’s thesis at Indiana University in Bloomington. The video-game-oriented media site serves as the basis for the Media Arts \u0026amp; Game Development degree program curriculum covering Video Production, Web Design and Programming, and New Media Marketing now being offered at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater.\nOther highlights included a presentation by Lynda Weinman, of Lynda.com, who spoke on “The changing role of educators in the digital age,” and constituent group meetings for attendees interested in Games and Learning and Digital Signage.

More and more, though, I begin to wonder exactly how the content is being used. How much is used directly in class? How much is on reserve for students to view as part of research assignments? How much of the content are students expected to watch all the way through?\nAs I started to ponder these questions earlier in the week, I came to the conclusion that the best way to find out is to ask. So, with help from some colleagues in the library and our center for the advancement of learning, I’m going to attempt to survey the faculty at the end of the term.\nThe questions above should be fairly easy to answer, but I wonder also about the pedagogical decisions to use media in the course. Is the media being “read” as a text? Is the media being watched for some intercultural purpose? Is it being used to enhance or reinforce language skills? Is it being used as an instructional or tutorial video? Does the selected media demonstrate a particular technique of filmmaking or storytelling? Or is it merely being used to elicit some kind of emotional response from the students? What drives the decision to use a particular film or video in class?\nThese are the questions I’m not quite sure of when thinking about a survey. How can I design the questions such that faculty will feel comfortable responding? Will they respond? Will they respond honestly? Will they feel defensive? Have they even considered these questions for themselves?\nChoosing media for a course should be no less important than choosing the texts, yet I cannot but wonder what’s driving the greater usage of media across the curriculum. Having a bit more insight into these choices may help us here in the library media center in turn help the faculty a bit more to achieve their teaching and learning goals.\n","date":"1 October 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-10-01-thats-more-than-entertainment-i-hope/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"That's (more than) Entertainment!

With its price point ($199), processing power (Dual-core CPU), screen resolution (1024x600), weight (14.6 ounces) and the full array of Amazon’s cloud-based services (books, music, video, apps), it appears to be a worthy alternative to the iPad. While I’m not convinced it will be the iPad-killer, it should take a big bite out of the tablet market.\nI’ve been an iPad user now for about a year and a half. Early on, my concerns were about productivity and whether or not the iPad could replace my laptop. With the release of the iPad 2, it has actually become my primary portable work device, the one I take to most meetings instead of a laptop. I can check e-mail, compose documents, read documents sent to me, surf the web and more. Except for an occasional Netflix movie, it rarely gets used as the entertainment device it once was, for me. And, it belongs to the College.\nNow, I may be in the market for a device for me, for my personal use, bought with my own money. The iPad, as much as I enjoy, is still a bit hard to justify at $500. The Kindle Fire hits the sweet spot, and I really think I can live without 3G features and cameras if it delivers on it other promises.

Plus, I already have an Android phone, so I’m already fairly comfortable with the OS.\nWith Christmas around the corner, the Amazon Kindle Fire may yet find its way under the tree.\nIt’s just too easy\u0026hellip;\n","date":"29 September 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-09-29-its-too-easy/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"It's too easy...","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tablet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tablet","type":"tags"},{"content":"First of all, let me say that I\u0026rsquo;m glad to be back with another post. Now, on to it\u0026hellip;\nThis is the time of year that my DVR gets its biggest workout\u0026ndash;the new Fall TV season. Not only am I eager to catch the return of favorite shows, but I am also on the lookout for a new show that is worth my time week to week. Like a Pokémon trainer, I feel like “gotta catch ‘em all.” And, indeed, I do try to catch many of the new shows.\nAlthough I feel pressed to watch all the new shows in a given window, I really don’t need to catch them all with my DVR, do I? Apparently, I’m not alone. According to a story on NPR’s All Things Considered yesterday, a recent survey of likely voters found that “31 percent of voters…had not watched live TV in the past week.” That doesn’t mean that they didn’t watch TV, only that they did not watch a TV program when it was broadcast.\nSo many options exist today. There are millions of Tivo owners and most cable companies offer DVR capabilities, too. Outlets such as Hulu and other online services, including the networks themselves, offer the programming “on demand.”\nWhat’s more, the real irony is that my behavior is more of a “catch and release” model. That is, I may record a number of shows, but will end up deleting them without even watching? Why? There are simply too many other options for my attention. (See the first post of this blog\u0026ndash;What\u0026rsquo;s your Media Montage?)\nSo, while there’s still a bit of TV-Guide Tetris to play with my and my DVR’s schedule, I accept the fact that I just might not see all the new shows I hope to see. And that’s ok. After all, what I miss on TV today, will probably be in our library DVD rack by next Spring, especially if it’s “The Complete Series” on a single disc.\n","date":"27 September 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-09-27-live-tv-time-shifting-and-the-new-tv-season/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Live TV, Time-shifting, and the New TV Season","type":"posts"},{"content":"\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_163\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Screenshot from Björk's Biophilia app\"\\] Biophilia Screenshot \\[/caption\\]I’m a bit of a sucker for creative experimental art, though much of it fails to really captures my attention long enough to become truly immersed in the experience. This hold true for digital versions as well as physical, real world installations. Going back to the earliest days with interactive CD-Roms, I can remember playing with Laurie Anderson’s “Puppet Motel” and thinking to myself how unique it was among other discs that were finding their way to market. \\[Does anyone else miss the work of The Voyager Company?\\]Since Apple opened their AppStore, a number of musical artist have released apps to accompany their albums or to provide some kind of connection between audience and artist. Most have simply been attempts to create a sort of interactive liner notes. I’ve downloaded them because I like the artist, but usually they don’t end up living long on my device once I’ve “played” through them.\nSo, it came as a bit of a surprise to me to discover Björk’s latest project on the iPad, a pre-album release app called Biophilia. I downloaded it a couple of days ago, but it sat idle until this weekend when I had a chance to tap on it. I always run a bit hot and cold when it comes to Björk and her music, but I am almost always impressed by her music videos and other projects. Tapping on Biophilia opened up a whirling galaxy of labelled constellations, stars on a black canvas connected with string art into a kinetic mobile-like Rorschach, as a British narrator introduces the project and leads us on a galactic fly-through of the space and invites us to explore it.\nAt the conclusion of the introduction, I navigate through the environment a bit before aiming toward the constellation burning brightest, a soaring bird-like vision of hash marks with a beaming yellow star at its beak, with the word “crystalline” hovering nearby. Tapping on the star takes me in orbit above the star, as a melody of crystal plinking sounds plays. If I zoom out or swipe slowly in other directions, the sounds of other stars begin to layer, or intrude, on the scene. Tapping the star again, I dive into the star, as a solid color fills the screen along with liner note material, skillfully executed. But not just liner note information. The text describes an interactive experience, a game. And there, on the upper left, a “buy now” option.\nBefore making an in-app purchase, I explore the rest of the galaxy, each constellation with its own unique melody, text, and app option, and all corresponding to a track on the upcoming album. A persistent icon hovers there in the upper left corner, twisting compass-like as I explore. Tapping it brings up all the track/constellation titles, shortcuts to the stars, and “cosmogong” in bold as the opening number. Tapping that, brings me the liner notes and links to the song’s intro, video, lyrics, credits, musical analysis by Nikki Dibben, music faculty member at The University of Sheffield specializing in music psychology, and versions of the song that playback as animation or with the accompanying score.\nTapping on “crystalline,” I decide to “buy now” and see what is offered. I pause a moment at the price, $1.99, but decide to take the plunge, realizing that, when the album is complete, I may ultimately be out almost $20, which is a bit steep. Once crystalline is purchased, the options are similar to “cosmogong,” with music, animation and more. The “play” option is new, though, and turns out to be a bit of a mashup of a tunnel racer game and Katamari Damacy, which has me traveling through multicolor geometric vector tunnels, tilting the ipad in all directions, trying to collect sequences of crystals of various colors, while the “crystalline” song plays in accompaniment. When the run ends, I may have unlocked new tunnels based on the crystal blob I created, and I can even save my crystal creation. Not the most thrilling of games, but this is more of a musical zen experience than a fast-paced shoot-em-up.\nFuture applets offer the promise of a lightening sound maker, a virus-themed instrument, a music sequencer, a scales tutor, a galactic harp, a fusion between biology and music, and a new musical notation system.\nIn the end, Biophilia may not be unique as a CD adjunct application with in-app expansion. However, I’m very pleased with its execution and it has succeeded in persuading me to engage with the artist and her music more than I might have otherwise. I just may end up buying more of the expansion applets as they are released, too. Since I will now also look for the disc (or the mp3 album, to be precise) upon its release, I guess I would say that Björk’s Biophilia is a success.\n","date":"25 July 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-07-25-app-review-bjorks-biophilia/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"App Review: Björk's Biophilia","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 July 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/apps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Apps","type":"tags"},{"content":"A Day Made of Glass\u0026hellip; Made possible by Corning. \\[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cf7IL\\_eZ38\\]I came upon this video in a blog posting that I recently read. I find the video somewhat inspiring for a world to come, even though it is nothing more than a futuristic glass commercial. The blog posting, too, was interesting because, geared to an audience of web designers, it asks, how do you design for a fixed web page layout when the landscape is just too broad to anticipate all devices or, in this case, all shapes and sizes of glass?\nI love this question. On the one hand it hits home for me as someone engaged in developing for technology consumption. While on the other hand, it goes to the very heart of the educational question that has been kicking around for decades\u0026ndash;how do you design a “fixed” education when the student audience is too broad and comes in all shapes and sizes, so to speak? The short answer, at least in one line of educational theory, is that you don’t design a fixed education. You create opportunities for students to design and build their own learning.\nOf course, can no more train our students for the job they will have when they are 40 than we can plan our media productions or our websites for the devices they will be using in 5 years. All we can do, realistically, is prepare them to confront change head on and give them the skills to adapt, to learn for themselves.\nBut that, too, has become a bit of an old saw at this point, not that I disagree with it.\nWhat I enjoy about the Corning video, about concept cars at auto shows, and about many startups (even though many fail), is that they are not confronting change and adapting in the same way. They are not “reacting” to the change; they are leading the change. They are forcing others to adapt. It’s about the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship.\nYes, we need to prepare our students in some way for the multiple careers they will have in their lifetime. Yes, we need to educate our students for a changing landscape. But, how do we educate them to become innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk takers? How do we equip them with the skills to BECOME the landscapers of the future? Can we teach them to “read” the Corning video and inspire them to begin planning to live and work in a world where that technology is the norm?\nAm I tilting at windmills?

While I have built and rebuilt several Windows systems for my personal use, my platform of choice remains the fruit vendor’s OS. Choosing to use Apple has never been about thrift. Rather, it has been about multilingual processing, avoiding viruses and trojans, and, frankly, “fit.” The only place where “thrift” entered into the argument was in saving time lost on maintenance rather than in saving money on the initial investment.\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_151\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Photo \"Shibuya's Hachiko Crossing\" by Tokyo Japan Times, available under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license.

Few early mp3 players played nice with Apple hardware, but an mp3 player itself didn’t warrant a full switch to Windows. But for my “needs,” I couldn’t justify the cost of the early iPods. So I waited and was eventually rewarded with the iPod Shuffle, which hit the sweet spot. \\[Side note: I still used my original iPod shuffle until 1 month ago, when it finally decided not to be seen when plugged into the USB port\\]. Later, with points saved on my credit card, I finally bought an iPod video, which I still use today.\nThen, Apple upped the game again with the iPod Touch, offering more than just music, but portable computing as well. And I’ve been a loyal Touch user since 2007.\nThe iPhone, however, is another story, and here, “thrift” kicks in.\nWhile much of my time is spent online, I’m not an avid cell phone user. Where I have lived and worked has not really required me to have a particularly mobile lifestyle, and the people I call the most are members of my family. I have never been able to justify a cellular telephone “plan,” with a two-year locked-in contract, in our family budget. So, since 2003-4, my family have been customers of Virgin Mobile USA, using inexpensive phones, pre-paid, no-contract service. We began with plans that required no more than $20 every three months! To date, we have rarely gone beyond that, although we have replaced our phones four times since we started. Our most recent phones cost us $10 and I pay only $20 every two months.\nBut, the story doesn’t end there.\nI have been itching for a smart phone. More accurately, I’ve been itching for a hand-held mobile computing device with a camera, WiFi and 3G service that fits in my pocket. I really could care less about the “phone” functionality, but the combination seems to mandate that it be a phone.\nThe iPad is great, but it doesn’t fit in my pocket. The new iPod Touch would be great, too, but it doesn’t have 3G service. And, even with a college employee discount, I just can’t make the argument, still, for the cell phone plan that an iPhone (3GS or 4) purchase would require. So, Apple, while I love your devices, I can’t afford to pay for the monkey on its back that is an AT\u0026amp;T or Verizon contract.\nOn Friday, thrift and my cell phone service loyalty found me as the owner of a brand new LG Optimus V Android-based smart phone from Virgin Mobile USA. I wanted to wait until the iPhone 5 announcement became official, but Virgin is changing its service plan this week and I decided to “lock in” for as long as possible to its “unlimited” Beyond Talk service. For $25 a month I’m offered unlimited text, email, data and web, along with 300 talk minutes (which I will never use up!).\nThe Optimus is certainly no iPhone (which may merit a blog post on its own), but it is a full-featured smartphone. While I honestly feel just a tinge “unclean” in breaking from Apple, I’m sure I’ll get over it when I see my cell statement. Oh, right, I don’t have one.\nNow, how do I get this on my campus network, mail and VPN?\n","date":"18 July 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-07-18-thrift-brand-loyalty-and-picking-a-smart-phone/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Thrift, Brand Loyalty and Picking a Smart Phone","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scholarly-publishing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scholarly-Publishing","type":"tags"},{"content":"Our library has just recently updated and posted its Mission and Goals for FY 2012, along with a new vision statement that I like for its succinctness and word play:\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_146\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" caption=\"Photo \"Printing Press Detail, Carl Paul Jennewein's Trylon (Washington, DC)\" by takomabibelot, available under a Creative Commons Attribution license.

Some of the goals are easier to aim at than others. I’ve already begun to think about ways in which we can help to market our resources and services to the campus community, for example. It is the loftier goals that challenge me to think more deeply. One of them is as follows:\nBuild collaborations to support faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student scholarly publishing\nI find it interesting, though not surprising for a library, that one of our goals centers on scholarly publishing. What I like about this is that I have keen interest in defining, redefining or broadening the definition of “scholarly publishing.” It’s not just about dead trees and ink anymore.\nIn years past, a media center would not necessarily be actively involved in the scholar publishing of faculty and students. But on our campus this has been changing over the past several years. We are seeing more and more courses across the curriculum offer students the choice of making a video or other multimedia project in lieu of a paper, and the quality of the work and the level of academic inquiry on these projects has increased as well.\nMany of these student scholars today are likely to become faculty scholars of tomorrow, and I’m confident that at least some of these students will publish and/or present their scholarship in ways that are not confined to text.\nNevertheless, there are efforts in the library, too, to play a larger role in digital publishing of journals and manuscripts. We are also actively encouraging greater awareness of the creative commons, both for sources and for determining the publishing rights of campus authors.\nThankfully, these are all areas where our media center can, in fact, contribute. As the hub for digital media resources on campus, we have been collaborating with faculty for years. I’m only too happy to build and strengthen the relationships and add what we can to ongoing scholarly publishing on our campus.\nWhat’s happening on your campus? Is your media center branching out to be more than a hardware/software loan service? If not, what’s holding you back? What are the challenges that you face?\n","date":"27 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-06-27-the-media-center-and-scholarly-publishing/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Media Center and Scholarly Publishing","type":"posts"},{"content":"\\[This is the second part of the series I [began last Friday](http://mediamixed.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-1/ \"Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots!

Today’s libraries collect books, journals, graphic novels, microfilm, films, videos, albums, cassette tapes, reel-to-reel tapes, CDs, DVDs. With video games becoming more and more the subject of academic inquiry, more libraries have begun acquiring games. Regardless of format, having ready access to materials in the collection encourages their use.\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_132\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Word Cloud of the article, \"Netflix in an Academic Library: A Personal Case Study,\" by Ciara Healy, published in Library Trends, Volume 58, Number 3, Winter 2010, pp. 402-411.\"\\] Netflix in an Academic Library \\[/caption\\]I remember the days of renting a film to show on campus. Prices for a single showing to a class could easily be hundreds of dollars and additional showings only increased the cost. With VHS and DVDs added to the collection, the ease-of-use and ready availability means that courses across the entire campus curriculum now make regular use of films, television shows, cultural programs, and documentaries. But digital-only assets threaten to move us back the other direction, back to limited availability and pay-per-loan/pay-per-show arrangements.\nWhere are the Netflix options for campus libraries? Kindle and Audible enterprise agreements? There was a big brouhaha last year when a library admitted to purchasing a few Netflix accounts to make streaming media available to their students. Current copyright and DMCA laws stifle the ability of libraries to make their physical collection available via streaming on campus, so alternatives are needed. Even were there a campus Netflix license, I’ve written before about the risk of asset access being suddenly revoked, due to either contract expirations or contract conflict between Netflix and the Hollywood distributors.\nWe are starting to see some modern digital asset agreements come to the library, but for the most part these licenses still treat the asset as a sparse resource. Audio books are available to a single patron and essentially self-destruct on the patron’s device at the end of the loan period. On the one hand, some digital collections can run tens of thousands of dollars annually regardless of how often the materials are used, and other collection items will self-destruct after as few as five digital “checkouts,” forcing the library to re-buy access to the item for another five loans. I would not object so much to this latter model except that the five-loan price is on par with that of a physical item that can be loaned out significantly more often.\nThere is currently no streaming video service for institutions with the breadth of something like Netflix. If given the option, I’m sure the MPAA would prefer to see libraries pay full retail for every loan of a Hollywood title. I’m certain that libraries are doing what they can to provide access to commercial materials through digital distribution agreements. But that effort needs to be escalated.\nEither the ALA needs a stronger lobby in D.C., or public, private and academic libraries across the U.S. need to band together more tightly to negotiate en masse for reasonably priced usage rights. If anyone has the historical foundation, resources, and imperative to do this, it is our libraries and librarians.\n","date":"10 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-06-10-your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots!

Libraries have been repairing, preserving and restoring their collections for years. Unfortunately, new technological formats appear to have much shorter shelf lives, but efforts to preserve them are often stymied by copyright or other law. Films (on celluloid), audio tape, and video tape are effectively disintegrating in their cans and boxes on shelves around the world, and librarians are helpless to act.\nUsually the last best hope at preservation of these items relies on copying the material onto a newer film stock or, as is more often the best option today, copying the material to a new format, from analog to digital, from film to DVD, for example. The process would, necessarily, create a copy of the original\u0026ndash;an act explicitly forbidden by copyright law. Copyright law does not permit this to be carried out without the permission of the copyright holder. Locating the the copyright holder itself can be a challenge with older materials. With newer material, such as DVDs, preserving a copy to another disc or digital file also violates the DMCA laws against circumventing DRM protection.\nFor years, many library activities have been governed by the rights of first-sale, allowing the owner of a good to do with it anything they wanted to do, short of violating the copyright on the content. Under the doctrine of first-sale, books could be loaned, sold, or rebound with no threat or limitations placed upon these activities. As we move to digital-only resources, the doctrine of first-sale is being subverted and replaced with licensing agreements, strictly limiting what a library may do with the material. I was surprised to learn that even books and other publications (non-digital items!) are starting to come wrapped with license agreements that supersede the doctrine of first-sale. These are no different from “click-through” agreements for software, which have been upheld in court, but which serious limit the rights of consumers.\nWith digital-only resources, who will preserve content and access to that content when the distributing companies and mechanisms disappear? One solution for scholarly journals is already in place and actively used by libraries at institutions around the world. The LOCKSS (Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) Alliance, “\u0026hellip; is an international community initiative that provides libraries with digital preservation tools and support so that they can easily and inexpensively collect and preserve their own copies of authorized e-content.” LOCKSS is actually a partnership between libraries and publishers to preserve access to electronic journal resources should the publisher or their online services disappear.\nAnother service, like LOCKSS, is Portico, which is also a digital preservation collaboration between publishers and librarians. According to their website, Portico currently has 712 library participants, 128 publisher participant, and holds a collection of over 114,000 book and journal titles in its collection, and is closing in on 300 million preserved files.\nThese digital repositories offer only one solution to the problems of preservation, however, and further solutions both legal and practical will need to be found.\nOur school, not unlike many others, are moving more and more resources and services into the cloud of the Internet. Even though so much information is available online, the service of libraries and librarians goes above and beyond the morass that is “the cloud.” Large amounts of the collective culture and history of the world are essentially still kept and maintained in libraries large and small across the planet. We need a reasonable approach to copyright that will to continue to support and train these knowledge workers so that they can continue to fight for the common good of us all.\n","date":"10 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-06-10-your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-3/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots!

Perhaps it is because the library does not seem to be the subject often enough of “pop“ scholarship. What they do, why they are still valuable to society, and the issues that affect the library are not the stuff of books that are finding their way to the bookstore shelves or the New York Times Bestsellers list. Where are the Blink, Outliers, or Freakonomics titles about the library? Where are the interesting survey books about the leading university libraries in the country or the turnaround stories about the head librarians who have rescued and reimagined their libraries for the 21st century?\nThere is so much happening in the library space today, as libraries struggle to redefine their mission and their audience, and to justify their continued existence. To non-librarians, libraries are still viewed primarily as book warehouses run by mature women with their hair in a bun who have nothing better to do than to go around ”shh“-ing patrons. That image couldn’t be farther from the truth.\nAlthough I work in a library, I am not a librarian, so I feel ill-equipped to fully describe ”the library today.“ What I do know is that, at academic institutions at least:\nLibraries continue to build their collections to facilitate ongoing research in all fields of campus scholarship, although more and more is shifting to digital format. They are partners with faculty in teaching courses and in guiding students to the materials they need to complete course research projects. They are training students, faculty, and staff how to use equipment, such as digital video cameras, audio recorders, and digital still cameras, and are teaching them how to use the software that enables them to edit, organize and present the digital recordings that they make as part of their personal projects and course assignments. They are involved in securing our history and culture through efforts to preserve physical items and to digitize as many assets in their current holdings as possible to make them more widely available for research. They are in the trenches on the front lines in the battles for reasonable and informed copyright law. \\[This last point in particular is a major piece that affects so many areas of the library and academic scholarship that I’ll leave it to a second post.\\]The point is, if you’re a librarian, you probably already know the activities of your library and the world of your professional community. You attend workshops and conferences, and you probably know exactly what journals and web sites to read to stay informed.\nBut, to the outsider, if we are looking for information about the modern library, we must be looking in all the wrong places, because clearly the ”Esoterism“ of the library is not finding its way to a mainstream audience. That is something that I hope will change. Maybe I can even be a part of it.\n\\[P.S.

What the Founding Fathers sought was a way to incentivize works of new knowledge but to avoid having copyright used for ”censorship and monopolistic oppression.“\nLibraries and librarians still seek to make materials available for the ”common good.“ They are not, as some industry leaders would imagine, trying to encourage piracy or hasten the death of capitalism and free markets.\nOne of the fronts on which librarians work is at the site of new knowledge production. Not only are they closely involved with faculty and students in the resource discovery process, but many librarians are active advocates for open publishing.\nAs more academic journals go digital, but with prices from journal publishers going up, not down, libraries look to the open access initiative to solve both cost and permission issues. Many are involved with or support digital journals published using the Open Journal Systems (OJS) of the Public Knowledge Project (PKP), which is designed to assist with ”\u0026hellip;every stage of the refereed publishing process, from submissions through to online publication and indexing.” The PKP itself, “\u0026hellip; brings together faculty members, librarians, and graduate students dedicated to exploring whether and how new technologies can be used to improve the professional and public value of scholarly research.”\nLibrarians are also involved in promoting broader academic use rights for faculty who publish. Through our library, we regularly run workshops for faculty on Creative Commons licensing. In these sessions, we not only hope to teach faculty where to find materials they can use safely in their own course materials and research, but we also try to promote the Creative Commons and educate faculty on how to release their own works under the terms of Creative Commons licenses.\nAdditionally, when faculty are entering into publication contracts, where possible, our institution also tries to help them secure their own future rights to their work, and tries to preserve current and future academic access to their work for the institution.\nThese are just a few examples related to knowledge production. This is a blog post, after all, not a journal article or book. Next, I’ll touch on efforts by librarians to continue to provide services and access to materials to the anytime-anyplace patron.\n","date":"9 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-06-09-your-librarian-wears-combat-boots-part-1/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Your Librarian Wears Combat Boots!

Unfortunately, it was not the service that many of us long-time Apple devotees were hoping for. Rather than a service enhancement, for those who have been MobileMe users throughout its many incarnations (iTools, .Mac, etc.), iCloud represents more of a service reduction or outright elimination. And even with Apple’s offer to extend MobileMe subscriptions for free until June 2012, many who just renewed prior to the announcement feel betrayed and cheated.\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_118\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Photo \"rainy season storm\" by Freestone Wilson, available under a Creative Commons Attribution, Noncommercial, Share Alike license.

(Apple even lost over a year of my mail in a server outage a few years back.) MobileMe has been the butt of many jokes, and many wonder why anyone would pay $99/year for services that can be had for free elsewhere. With so many free services vanishing from the Internet, however, a paid service from Apple offering web hosting, image and file sharing, hardware tracking, cloud storage, e-mail, contacts, calendaring and PIM and third-party synching seemed like a reliable, reasonable service offering that would be around for a while.\nAnd now, Apple has pulled the carpet out from under us once again. Loving Apple is like being in an abusive relationship\u0026ndash;they limit you, they tell you exactly what they want you to do, and they will constantly keep you on edge with their unpredictability, but they keep you coming back for more. I realize this is not exclusive to Apple, but they do it with such a particular style.\nWith iCloud, gone is the 20GB of iDisk storage. Gone are the photo and video galleries linked from iPhoto albums and iMovie. Gone are the iWeb-built hosted web sites. Gone, too, is the $99/year price tag.\nWhat remains? Well, e-mail, contacts, calendaring will still sync, but it is unclear whether or not they will be accessible via the web if you are away from your devices. It is also unclear whether third-party apps that sync through MobileMe will still be able to sync.\nThe iCloud will allow for automatic daily backup of iOS devices, but I find it comical that Apple is only offering 5GB of storage now when none of their iOS devices have anything less than 8GB of storage capacity. That 5GB allowance is also supposed to be used for mail and documents, too. This makes things even more hilariously disappointing for those who have had 20GB available to us. My e-mail archive alone is close to 2GB.\nThat iCloud will expand my music sync’ing across up to 10 devices seems like a good thing, but it is limited to only iTunes-purchased music, unless I go for the iTunes Match service. The Match service, for $25/year will allow me to match music in my collection with that stored in Apple iTunes Music Store, and then sync those songs to all my devices. Is that a good service? I guess it depends on how you acquire music.\nIf you acquire music legally through other non-iTunes sources, you are effectively paying $25/year for the privilege of pushing those songs to all your devices through the iCloud. But, if you’ve acquired your music through less than legal means, you are effectively paying a $25/year fee for music amnesty. Seems like a boon to pirates, but less than ideal for legal acquisitions purchased through Amazon or other music services.\nIn total, I have to say that this is probably the least impressed I’ve ever been by a significant Apple announcement, and it still doesn’t fully address my music sharing and distribution needs. For me, all in all, things are still cloudy, and I must admit, Apple has actually rained on my MobileMe parade.\n","date":"8 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-06-08-still-a-little-cloudy/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Still a little cloudy","type":"posts"},{"content":"I met my father when I was 9 years old. It was the summer of 1977, and my older siblings and I had flown back to Texas to spend the summer with him, as we lived with our mother and step-father in Pennsylvania at the time. It was my first airplane flight, but aside from that, there is little that I remember of that summer, except for the movies. After all, it was the summer of Star Wars. But that’s not really what this post is about. \\[On a side note, we saw _The Deep_ and _Orca_ that summer, too.\\]\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_112\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Photo \"Rockland Drive-In 'Theatre'\" by PLCjr, available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license.

There were camping trips, and Friday nights spent at the police officers’ club, where my dad and his band played, and shopping at the mall, but more than that I often link my memories of time spent with my dad to the movies we would go out and watch as a family on those weekend nights.\nSince there were my brother, my step-brother, my dad and me, male preferences dominated the selections. So, for example, Alien and Poltergeist were big hits for us. But, at the same time, Coal Miner’s Daughter was enjoyed by everyone, including my step-mother. While subsequent re-viewings of the films have solidified the stories in my memory, there are these snippets of before or after exchanges with my family that fix the viewing experience itself in time and memory. Naturally, we would comment on how we enjoyed the movie, the quality of the special effects and on the parts that scared or shocked us the most, but we would also debate or discuss pieces of the story that never seemed to be sufficiently tied up and would ponder the likelihood of sequels.\nWhat brought all of this to mind was the movie Tron Legacy. The original Tron film came out in 1982, when I was 15. I went to see it with my dad, who would have been 41 or so at the time, and my younger step-brother. There is almost the same age difference between my dad and me as between me and my son, so it seems almost appropriate that I had the pleasure of taking my son to see Tron Legacy when it came out last winter (note: the pleasure was more in spending time with my son). When we went, my son was just a year older that I was when the original came out. Coincidentally, too, the film is about fathers and sons and loss and redemption, themes which, thankfully, probably resonate more with me than with my son. But, this is not all about some kind of spooky similarities, but rather just a “it kind of hit me” moment.\nIt also made me think more about the impact of movies, on our memories. More specifically, the impact that “going to see a movie” has on our memories. Certainly, we know that news events delivered through our television (such as 9/11) can leave indelible imprints, but I want to believe that there is something more about the theater experience. Is it the place? The community experience? The richer, multi-sensory factors? Or the act of going?\nWhatever it is, the experience for me sticks and lodges itself deeper into my mind than any home-viewing event does. I don’t know why, but if you name a movie, for every one that I’ve ever seen in a theater (and there have been MANY), I can probably recall some aspect about that experience, whether it was a free screening, a $1 bargain show, or a 3D spectacle.\nAm I alone in this, or can you say the same?\n","date":"3 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-06-03-moving-memories/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Moving Memories","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cloud/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cloud","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 June 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/google/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Google","type":"tags"},{"content":"Yesterday we read of Apple’s announcement that Steve Jobs will address the assembled loyal at the WWDC event this summer, and that he will be talking about the rumored iCloud service.

You access your music with a web-based cloud player, thought there is an Android app to access your music on the go. There is uploader application to move your existing music to your amazon cloud drive. The application will scan your computer for music and playlists and will even report which ones cannot be uploaded, either for DRM reasons (all my legacy iTunes purchases) or for size or format issues. Unfortunately, one DRM song in a playlist makes the whole playlist ineligible. And, while new song purchases through Amazon do not impact the 20GB of storage, I’m a bit miffed that they are not including all your previous Amazon mp3 purchases. I made the switch for iTunes to Amazon several years ago and Amazon knows every song I’ve purchased, even reminding me before I accidentally try to purchase the song again, so this limitation just doesn’t make any sense to me.\nAs with many of Google’s services, it’s Google Music cloud product is in limited beta release for now, but provides space for up to 20,000 songs. LifeHacker has a good first look at the service. Like Amazon, there is a Music Manager tool and an Android app to access your music on the go. One nice feature of the Google Music Manager tool is its ability to watch a folder for new music changes and automatically upload them to your cloud account. It’s player will offer Genius-like mixes and other features. I’m still waiting for my beta invite, but just reading about the polish on the Google Music web player makes me eager to give it a try.\nBut, by the end of summer, I’ll be in a real quandary when it comes to my music collection. Where exactly do I want to keep my music for remote access? Right now, I’m actually running the Orb server on a machine at home, which gives me access just about anywhere I have an Internet connection. But, I do have to copy new music to it as it runs all alone on a box in the corner of the room, and it doesn’t see all of my iTunes playlists, which is a downside.\nAs a long-time MobileMe account holder (back to the beginning, when it was free, and before it was called MobileMe), I’m very curious to learn the details of the iCloud service. With both Amazon and Google, I would need to upload my music, which could take quite a while. Since Apple acquired LaLa, there is the possibility that the iCloud service will simply scan my collection and make it available to me online, which would be a time saver. Also, I feel that Apple is more likely to release an app for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch devices as well, which Amazon and Google do not yet have. But, then again, I’m also a Roku owner, and who will play first on my Roku device?\nAh, the paralysis of choice! For now, I just don’t know. I will continue to buy music from Amazon, and will continue to download a copy for my offline use and mobile devices, but the future of my music collection is definitely still clouded.\nAre you dealing with the same conundrums? Have you decided where your music collection will live?

When you are editing a recorded performance, you are usually working with either multiple recordings of the same performance (ideally) or trying to splice together multiple recordings of the performance over several shows.\nThe former is similar to live editing a television broadcast, switching between cameras and calling shots to the camera operators in preparation for a switch. The performance is singular and you get lucky if you can capture the right angle at just the right moment.\nThe latter resembles how one puts together a film. You setup your location, set your cameras, and have your actors run through their performance several times. Then you switch camera positions and have the actors run their performances again. You may do this many times depending on the angles that the director wants to incorporate into the final production. Then, in editing, the best of the bits and pieces are put together. Much like film and video offer the illusion of motion by quickly presenting multiple still images, this kind of editing creates the illusion of a single “performance.”\nWhen you are a parent recording your child’s school performance, you generally only get the one chance, so there is very little to work with after the fact. You can strip out the filler of the teacher’s comments or the solo performance by the golden child of the school, but in general we either capture the whole show or just our child’s performance. And then, most of us probably do the pan left-pan right, or zoom in-zoom out work necessary to focus our attention on our children. Of course, all of that panning and zooming can be hell to work with if you ever do get down to editing, though we probably never will.\nI think this is why we all have so many boxes of video tapes, flash cards, or DVDs that have never been edited. For most of us, film and video are really no different from the shoebox of photos under the bed (for older readers) or the ever expanding hard drives full of digital photos. They are the backups of our physical life experiences\u0026ndash;unedited.\nWe know from brain science that our brains are very different from the shoebox or hard drive. Our brains are editing the memories, distilling them into a fine liqueur. But I’m ok with that. At least for now, I have both\u0026ndash;the pleasurable brain edits, and the raw footage.\n","date":"26 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-26-unedited-memories/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Unedited Memories","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/craft/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Craft","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/games/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Games","type":"tags"},{"content":"Maker Faire, an inspiring event that I absolutely need to attend in person at some point, just wrapped up in San Francisco, and I found myself browsing on theeveny website for video reports from the show.

They employ Max/MSP software and the motion sensing capabilities and the limited buttons on the game controller to synthesize a wide variety of musical sounds.\nThey have also released code as a freely downloadable, open source project called FRETBUZZ so that others can begin making real music with their game-based instruments. The software and guide is available on their site, theguitarzeros.com. Another limited time beta project is available, too. It’s called Music Construction Set: The Blues, and is available at 1louderthan10.ea.com.\nOn a side note, what caught my attention early on in the accompanying video was that Owen Grace’s exposure to Max/MSP, the tool that really inspired him to push the limits of what can be done, came while taking classes in the graduate digital music program at Dartmouth College.\nIn the same way that TEDx conferences are popping up at educational institutions around the world, I wonder what it would take to bring a version of Maker Faire to campus?

Although I have not yet read the article in full, I did catch NPR’s All Things Considered from the same date, in which host Robert Siegel interviews Gladwell about the topic. I will definitely seek the full article (and may even download the issue as a first for my iPad), but a few quotes from the interview stood out for me.\nGladwell describes Steve Jobs’ visit to Xerox PARC and how he comes away, not as a “thief,” as some portray him, but as someone who realizes that the clunky mouse he has just seen needs to be dramatically transformed in order to make it both useful and commercially viable. Gladwell goes on to say, “\u0026hellip;we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t think about revolutions having an inventor. We should only think of them as having inventors,” \\[emphasis mine\\] and “ I think that we wrongly fetishize being first in a technological revolution\u0026hellip;.”\nI work in higher education, at a school that is famous as one of the early innovators and early adopters of technology. These days, however, it seems like we are consuming more technology than we produce, in terms of either innovation or evolution. We now spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on the “safety” of “enterprise solutions.” It may kill me to say it, but I can get over that for the most part. After all, we’re talking about the “tools” of the trade of modern education.\nBut, even though we may have given up on developing the tools, we in education cannot give up on being party to the revolution. How we educate cannot go backwards. The world has changed too much, and our education systems need to continue to evolve to meet the challenges. We have all these “tools” available to us, but we need to develop more revolutionaries. We need a larger cadre of innovative teachers. There are many of them out there, don’t get me wrong. What I mean, though, is that I want more of them on my campus, and on yours.\nHigher ed today is not about revolution. The safest route to tenure is the quietest one. Not only do I want more faculty to take risks with their teaching, to try new things, to get help and advice on teaching and learning, but I also want our students to graduate with the courage to take risks and try new things in their fields. I want them to have learned how to take the risks, and to value and appreciate what that means when others do so.\nThere are essays and books that talk about our nation’s top students not as being necessarily the smartest or most innovative, but as the ones who have “figured out” how the system works and who do as little as possible to score the grades that they need. These are not the risk takers that will drive our planet forward. We don’t need our students to jump in front of bullets, but we need our graduates to understand that the safest route is not always the best route.\nThey should see that, too, in the classroom, from their teachers. Education is messy. There is no one “way” to teach or to learn. Unfortunately, far too many instructors stand before their students, deliver the material, and hope they get it. That’s neither evolution nor revolution.\nThere is no law, like NCLB, that will “create” an educated citizenry. Nor will there be one individual who comes up with THE best way to teach. So, what can I do to fan the flames of a creative revolution in teaching and learning?

This is the subject I address further here.\\]My son first brought Minecraft to my attention almost a year ago, when he asked my approval to spend the money to buy a copy, because “other kids at school” were playing with it and he wanted to join in. At the time, the cost was about $10. I didn’t quite “get” it when he first described it to me, but liked the retro look that it had and the cost was trivial. He encouraged me to download a copy to play with, which I did, and he gave me a couple of quick starter points. The next several hours disappeared as I explored, dug, collected and built. I’ve played a couple of times since, but I’ve kept myself from becoming addicted by simply not launching the game too often.\nI have, however, become an consumer of Minecraft-related information online. There are quite a number of videos on YouTube, both of tutorials and guides, but also of the beautiful creations. It’s like an 8-bit version of “Cribs” or “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.” My recent favorite is the video below, a recreation in Minecraft of notable places from Studio Ghibli films like My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Porco Rosso.\n\\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zTtwXQ5PJM\\]So, I was happily surprised to come across the recent article on the “Eureka’s Castle” site about Joel Levin, a New York City teacher who has begun using Minecraft in his elementary classrooms. He built a custom world in Minecraft to first teach the kids how to use Minecraft, and is starting to explore ways to use Minecraft in the curriculum. His blog, The Minecraft Teacher, describes his experiences, includes videos of his Minecraft Tutorial World and his teaching, and has links to other Minecraft-in-education stories.\nSimilarly, Lucas Gillispie, an Instructional Technology Coordinator in North Carolina has created the Minecraft in School Wiki, to host “ideas, lessons, implementation strategies and more related to using the game, Minecraft, in a school setting.” The wiki is still in the early stages of development, but there are already placeholders and some brainstormed ideas for lessons on cartography, language arts, mathematics, and science. Not surprisingly, Gillispie has created similar wiki sites for “iPod Games for Learning” and “World of Warcraft in School.”\nWhat exactly can you do in Minecraft that is educational? The following video is just one example of a student project, a recreation of the Alamo for a school assignment. Clearly this required researching history, some 3D construction skill (but nothing like SecondLife), and embedded other aspects of the assignment.\n\\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eSDbug8X\\_8\\]For now, the sites exploring educational uses of Minecraft are largely geared to K12 education, but I expect that to change over time. SecondLife took a while to really make inroads in higher education discussions, but eventually did and many schools (and companies) spent a lot of money to develop virtual real estate there. I believe the barrier to entry for Minecraft is much lower and is easier to control. For that reason alone I expect more people to begin examining the possibilities. If nothing else, our education and teacher-training programs should at least introduce products like Minecraft as potential tools to encourage student learning.\n","date":"18 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-18-minecraft-for-education-part-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Minecraft for Education - Part 2","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"18 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/secondlife/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Secondlife","type":"tags"},{"content":"\\[Note: This post was becoming too long, so I’ve decided to break it up over the next couple of days.\\] Minecraft inspired image When I was 10 years old I was hitting a digital puck across the screen with a digital paddle playing Pong. My son at age 10 was learning metallurgy and materials management in an online multiplayer game called Runescape!\nI knew nothing of the game at the time, and he soon showed me how he learned to collect items in the world in order to make new things that he needed to complete quests and gain experience. In particular, he showed me how he needed to collect certain metal ores, take them to a smelter to extract metals, and then take those to a forge to create tools or to a craftsman to make other things. This is one of the reasons that I am still excited about Minecraft.\nIf you haven’t heard of Minecraft, what Luddite community do you belong to? I apologize. That is much too harsh. But, if you are a technologist who has not heard about Minecraft, go rectify that as soon as you’re done reading this post.\nAs for a description of Minecraft, I’ll leave that to the Minecraft Wiki:\nMinecraft is a sandbox construction game, inspired by Infiniminer, and created by Markus Persson, the founder of Mojang AB. The game involves players creating and destroying various types of blocks in a three dimensional environment. The player takes an avatar that can destroy or create blocks, forming fantastic structures, creations and artwork across the various multiplayer servers in multiple game modes.\nMinecraft has swept the world since its release in 2009, and it hasn’t even gone to a version 1.0 release, which is currently scheduled for later this year. In that way, I suppose, it resembles a Google product. While it is a described as a game, I would more accurately define it as a tool for play, since there is no particular goal to achieve. Even though there are creatures, both domesticated and wild, that you can kill or be killed by, there is no “mission” to complete that requires killing at all. There are no missions period.\nIn that way, Minecraft greatly resembles SecondLife. Minecraft is as much a user-constructed world as is SecondLife, with some significant differences. First, the Minecraft world looks like what SL might have looked like had it been developed in the early 1990s\u0026ndash;it is decidedly low-resolution, a features that only adds to its charm. In Minecraft, there are no properties to own, no in-world currency systems, no stores, and no avatar rave parties (yet). But, there are also no presentation tools, no audio chat, and no online conferences. For me, SL is a social environment with lots of possibilities, but one that so often feels empty unless I enter for a specific purpose or event. Minecraft, on the other hand, is a private environment that I can choose to make a social one.\nIf SecondLife could be considered an alternate world, then Minecraft is an alternate galaxy. In SL, everyone inhabits a large, single, shared world. In Minecraft, each instance of the game is a unique world. There is a multiplayer version now, so many players can inhabit a shared environment, but the general Minecraft player is a master of their own collection of worlds. In the multiplayer version, players can text chat to one another, but the conversation is more likely to be about “building stuff” than about where they bought their avatar clothing. Building and exploration are the core of Minecraft.\nIn SL, I can’t tell you how many times I would go to a sandbox area to begin trying my hand at constructing 3D objects. Each time I became either bored or frustrated. I simply am not a 3D modeler. In Minecraft, though, construction is child’s play. Really! It is very much like playing with Legos\u0026ndash;you create by simply laying blocks (of different element) or digging away blocks. But you also learn how to combine different block types into new materials, from which you can then create different tools, devices, and structures. Thankfully, there are complete “recipe” guides online to teach you how.\nThrough this system of materials collection and scaffolded construction, a Minecraft player resembles my son and the skills he was learning in Runescape. It is that combination of creativity, exploration and collaboration that educators are now starting to explore in Minecraft, which I will address in Part 2.\n","date":"17 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-17-mindcraft-for-education-part-1/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Minecraft for Education - Part 1","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mashup/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mashup","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/visualization/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Visualization","type":"tags"},{"content":"I’m dating myself, I’m sure, to recall the old Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup commercial where the guy with the peanut butter runs into the guy with the chocolate bar and the happy accident brings home the tag line, “Two great tastes that go great together.” Anyway, that’s how I felt this weekend when I came upon the perfect blending of a song mashup and a visualization, two of my favorite uses of technology.\nAnatomy of a Mashup As you’ll see if you visit “Anatomy of a Mashup,” Cameron Adams created a mashup from the work of the electronic musicians Daft Punk, 23 songs to be precise. He then went one step further to create the live visualization of the mashup, so you can hear his creation, watching as each new pieces is introduced during playback, and you can follow the timeline to see exactly how each piece of music was layered into the final product. Overall, a very impressive work.\nI didn’t recognize the name at first, but clicking through the music video took me to Adams’ website, The Man in Blue, where I discovered him to be the author of one of the cool web coding books on my digital bookshelf, Simply Javascript, (published by SitePoint, a great press!). Adams describes himself as a “Web Technologist,” which means “he does graphic design, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, writing, server-side jiggery pokery, and anything else that takes his fancy that day.” I guess that makes him a bit of a mashup himself.\nTo get back to his visual mashup, though, I like how educational the whole project is.

Specifically, TVGuide.com’s general manager and executive vice president of TV Guide Digital, Christy Tanner, will present at the Mashable Connect event today on how “social” television programs are, based on TVGuide.com checkin, Facebook likes, and site comments.\nSome of the information released so far on the Mashable site points out that, while shows like NCIS and American Idol are both big ratings earners, programs like Glee and Smallville are among the top 10 “social shows” despite lower ratings. Twitter appears to be the primary tool for engagement, with 50% of users tweeting while watching. TVGuide.com also has gathered information on how people are using device-specific apps to interact with television shows. A quick check of the iTunes App Store shows that the Glee Karaoke app is still one of the Top 150 bestselling apps and is one of the Top 10 highest grossing music apps.\nI am not alone in believing for years that Nielsen ratings by themselves are poor indications of program popularity. Not only that, but viewership is only one data point offering feedback to the program’s producers. I’ve participated in surveys and focus groups for television programming in the past. I remember one survey in particular from the early days of NBC’s “The Office” that asked for my opinions on all of the characters, how I felt about the relationship between Pam and Jim, and whether I wanted some characters to be featured more often than others. Now, from a simple Twitter search, researchers can gauge audience feedback coast-to-coast in real-time and determine what’s working and what isn’t. During last Fall’s rollout of new shows, television critics were quick to gauge the potential success of a new show based on how much buzz it was receiving in social networks.\nNone of this is particularly new to me. I recall during the 2008 Presidential Candidate Debates using my television and my computer, with multiple windows open, to track the Twitterverse chatter, online streams from several news outlets along with their accompanying live-pulse data, and sites that were doing real-time fact-checking of the candidates’ answers. It was overload, but at the same time I marveled at the situation, too.\nEvery conference I attend now has an active “back channel” during presentations, and these are often as informative or more so than the presenter. They also provide a “record” of the event that is richer than my notes have often been. Schools and faculty are using instant-feedback devices to gauge student engagement and responses to lectures, especially in large classes. I don’t expect faculty contracts to be “cancelled” like TV shows, but I do believe that the back channel can provide useful information, especially if intentionally tapped into during the class or addressed afterward in online discussions or future class sessions. Yes, there is always fluff and other noise, but in 140 characters or less, it can actually be filtered through quite easily.\nAfter years of hearing doom-and-gloom predictions about how the computers and the Internet would lead to less and less human interaction, I think we are more engaged than ever. At least, many of us are.\nHow about you? Do you participate in the back channel during conferences or during your favorite TV show? Let me know in the comments.\n","date":"13 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-13-the-social-tv-experience/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Social TV Experience","type":"posts"},{"content":"At 9:26 p.m. last night, from just off to the right of and behind my browser window, my eye detected the slightest upward movement of my iChat avatar icon. A response must have come in from my wife, even though my Dock icon did not simultaneously bounce. I Command-Tabbed over to iChat to see my lonely avatar standing above the message, “You left the chat or were disconnected.” I’ve been seeing this problem recently so I wasn’t surprised. I quickly fired up Skype and found no one online there either. Curious. Next, my browser began struggling to load the page\u0026hellip;any page. Alright, must be the wireless router. The web page to that also was only intermittently responsive. Reset the router and confirmed that there was now no WAN address. My cord was unceremoniously pulled and I found myself disconnected. COMCAST!!!!\nOk, it was time to try the other approaches. Pulled plugs on the cable modem and the router and let them sit while I went to do dishes. After 10-15 minutes, I powered up everything again but still found no WAN connection. No, instead my cable modem and router decided to attend a private disco party, dancing to their own music while tapping out unknown rhythms with all their LEDs. By this time nearly an hour has passed. I was getting close to calling it a night, but decided to call Comcast to see if there was larger system outage.\nExcept, of course, I have the Comcast Triple-Play package and just then discovered that I’ve got a runner on base (my cable television signal), two outs (Internet AND phone), and no more players left to call up to bat! Not only that but my pay-as-you-go cellphone, my pitch hitter, was down to 4 minutes of credit, which would barely get me through the voice-activated menu. At that point, I’m essentially dead in the water and out of options other than to simply head to sleep, which I did.\nHowever, during this small adventure, it occurred to me, once again, that I am far more reliant on my connectivity than I realize. Even without being half-machine, like a cyborg, I’m am just as dependent on my power and connection to the digital world. I’m not blind to my purely analog options, and could easily have entertained myself with a book, or could have gone to the kitchen to make a pot of tea, or done any number of things that did not rely on an Internet connection. In daytime hours, I would be more than willing to work outside, take a stroll, or tinker in the garage. Even last night, I could have even just plopped myself back down on the sofa to watch television, but that was the passive alternative.\nWhat was unique last night was that I happened to have been in an information gathering mode and felt that connections were vital. I was in the middle of a several conversation threads on Facebook. I was similarly engaged in some e-mail back-and-forths. I was just about to chat with my wife, who currently happens to be 3000+ miles away. And when I realized the problem rose to the level of “engage with customer support,” even that avenue was closed to me. When I felt I needed my access most, its loss was more acutely felt.\nPerhaps it is an oxymoron or a misnomer to claim to be an “organic cyborg,” but even with no inorganic body parts, technology plays such a strong role in my life that I feel less complete, less active, and less engaged, when I am unplugged.\n\\[Note: normal connectivity appears to have been restored at 6:43 a.m. this morning.\\]","date":"12 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-12-unplugged-the-organic-cyborgs-dilemma/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Unplugged!

What struck me right from the start was this passage in the opening “Note to the American Edition”:\n\u0026hellip;we need to rethink some of our received models, so embedded within print and its powerful heritage (both cultural and legal), in order to better appreciate the new dimensions of digital culture. In the same manner that digital tools disturb our received ideas about authorship and reading, digital literacy invites a new look and an evaluation of what it means to be literate. In the digital environment, more so than at any other moment in the past, literacy is the agency not only of communication and the production and exchange of knowledge; it is also the site of the deployment of a new iteration of individual and collective identities. In this fashion, it is also the site of a conflict, one opposing our inherited practices and their powerful history and the emerging new world of digital culture. (p. x)\nAnd then in the preface, a somewhat similar statement:\n\u0026hellip;one can say that the digital environment is at the moment experiencing a crisis derived from its early reliance and desire to carry over and extend elements of print culture (such as embedded and legal forms of authorship, copyright, but also crucial concepts such as page, book and the notions of property associated with them) into its own, and from its current desire, in part due to the development of new technologies and their associated emerging practices, to liberate itself from the weight of such a burden. (p. xiv)\nI’m looking forward to reading this book and seeing how Doueihi develops these ideas more fully, but I must say that I am particularly intrigued by these statements. These are issues that I struggle with on a regular basis working in a technical field within a higher education setting, and even more so now that I am part of a library culture that is also wrestling with these issues. For the library, I believe these are of interest because it is going to be nigh impossible to escape from the print heritage as long as publishers continue to root all business transactions and legal authority in that legacy world. And, let’s not kid ourselves, libraries have untold millions invested in the print culture that sits on their shelves.\nThe libraries, however, are adapting to digital changes and the librarians with whom I work are more than willing to engage in these sites of conflict. I believe many of the bibliographers and teaching librarians view themselves as stewards not of “print culture” but of “information.” They are as invested as I am in helping students and faculty figure out ways of navigating and making sense of our digital culture, and in pushing faculty to think critically about how it differs from our print heritage. Those conversations alone can be challenging ones, as many of our faculty are not convinced that it IS different, that bits on a screen are no different than ink on a page.\nNevertheless, we press on, not with answers but with the candlelight of our convictions to help guide us into the foggy future. I hope that in reading Doueihi’s book I may be able to increase the brightness of that candle even a tiny bit.\nLibrarians, assuming you have not already read this book, I would love to hear your thoughts on the above two statements and I would like to invite you to read the book as well, perhaps for a follow-up conversation and posting.\n","date":"11 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-11-digital-cultures-and-the-print-heritage/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Digital Cultures and the Print Heritage","type":"posts"},{"content":"In the past couple of years, several people have been working to bring to the fore the idea that remixing our culture should not be viewed as criminal (as in copyright violation), but is in fact almost core to our cultural development\u0026ndash;that ours is a remix culture. You hear it in music all the time. Books, movies, TV shows\u0026hellip;they all borrow from the past. The remix is explicit in the works of artists like DJ SPOOKY (such as in his Re-Birth of a Nation film) and it is a topic that Lawrence Lessig discusses often as well (in books, in public speeches, in magazines, and in his blog, which is now on sabbatical, but worth a read).\nThe latest example I came upon is the site “Everything is a Remix” by Kirby Ferguson, a New York-based filmmaker. Ferguson is planning a four-part video series. The first two episodes have been completed, with a third to follow this summer. He is also using the site to solicit financial support for this project. The site itself, which is an ongoing blog about the project, not only provides the videos, but also samples, references, links to information about all the tools he’s using in the production of the work.\nIn the latest blog posting, Ferguson announces that he is opening up the production to outside contributors. “Whatever you do – videography, photography, motion, graphic design, illustration, research, whatever – could find its way into the next installment.” (Contribute to Everything is a Remix Part 3). The blog also contains links to other remix works, links to source materials, links to the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Flattr, and GoodieBag.tv) and more. It’s like viewing the DVD extra before the film is even complete.\nProjects such as these represent a new take on an old form. There’s not really much here that stands out as particularly different from what documentary filmmakers have been doing for years to get their films made. It is, however, a great example of using new media outlets and skills throughout the production process.\nI strongly recommend that you take a look and check back in as the final parts eventually get released.\n","date":"10 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-10-long-tail-heroes-2-kirby-ferguson-remix-is-everything/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Long-Tail Heroes #2: Kirby Ferguson \"Remix is Everything\"","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/long-tail-heroes/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Long-Tail-Heroes","type":"tags"},{"content":"Today I wasn’t quite sure what I would write about until I stumbled upon this excellent video on Gamifying Education. Okay, I only partially stumbled upon it. I’m a fan of several of the video segments that appear on The Escapist, but that is beside the point.\nAnyway, I really think the video speaks for itself as topics go, but there are two issues that occurred to me while watching it. 1) I really wish we could teach our students to communicate this effectively. This particular video style is becoming more common, with fast cuts and combinations of simple hand drawn illustrations along with carefully, and cleverly, selected photos to communicate the message in memorable ways. 2) I wonder how transferrable the kinds of gamification they describe would be to the college level? I don’t doubt that what they describe is doable, but I think it would take quite a bit more effort to scale the activities to the college student demographic. But, maybe I’m wrong.\nThere are certainly challenges to and valid criticisms of gamification, and I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not suggesting it as a panacea for all teaching.

Think of it describing a TV show, person or site that you like that you think not enough people know about. I’m calling the series “Long-Tail Heroes” because that seems like the best way to describe them. They’ve earned my respect for their willingness to play to the small audience out of a love for what they do. I’m sure that some of them would be more than happy to move further up the tail, but they seem primarily interested in doing what they do just because they want to do it.\nIn the troll-filled world of the Internet, it takes guts to put yourself out there, but the ones I\u0026rsquo;ll write about are not the one-hit wonders with silly home videos. These are the ones who are much smarter than that, the ones who craft their message, or persona, or who demonstrate a particular skill in using the new media tools and outlets available to them. While this may not seem particularly academic on the face of it, I think that these are skills that many of our students should learn to develop, not only for themselves, but potentially for the companies and/or institutions that they will eventually lead.\nFor this, they are my modern day heroes of the Internet.\nOn to episode #1:\n\\[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YE2FwgXf28\\]A couple of days ago, a friend embedded a YouTube video on FaceBook that I felt compelled to share back out. The video (above) was of a red-haired, teenage girl with braces rockin’ a cover of OutKast’s “Hey Ya” on her ukulele. I watched it a couple of more times, impressed by her performance, her naturalness and her spirit. I decided to switch over to YouTube to see what else she may have posted and was surprised to see not just a handful of videos, but forty! She’s 16 from Dublin, Ireland, and has only been on YouTube since 2009. Her videos are a combination of guitar and ukulele performances for the most part, and she really is quite talented.\nWhat impressed me even more, though, was seeing how she is starting to develop her social marketing skills, which paid off recently when she caught the attention of Michael Buckley, YouTube personality and host of his own “What the Buck Show.” Getting a mention from Buck lifted her subscriber numbers to over 20,000. According to one of her latest videos, getting noticed was partly an effort by a friend of hers, BriBry, who is also a musician but whose YouTube channel is primarily devoted to videotaping his list of “things to do before you die.“\nOrla Gartland’s video has links out to BriBry’s music on iTunes, The Buck Factor episode that featured her, as well as links to her Twitter feed (with over 1100 followers) and Facebook fan page (with over 10,000 ”likes“). She also maintains a Blogger site, though clearly she is compartmentalizing her broadcasts over her various social media channels. I find that kind of social intelligence quite amazing, but for her, I’m guessing, it is all quite natural.\nI\u0026rsquo;m now subscribing to her YouTube channel as well, and wish her continued success.\n","date":"6 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-06-long-tail-heroes-1-orla-gartland/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Long-Tail Heroes #1: Orla Gartland","type":"posts"},{"content":"Last year there was a bit of a brouhaha about libraries using Netflix streaming accounts to provide patrons with access to streaming media in the Library. For more information about that case you can read about it here:\nFastCompany, Librarians Gone Wild: Violating Netflix Terms of Use! by David Zax, Mon Sep 20, 2010.\nAs much as I would love to see a Netflix-like service for institutions, there is one aspect about the market today that troubles me\u0026ndash;long-term access. One of the great things about our library is that, for the most part, if we own something in our collection, it will always be available to our patrons. It may be temporarily loaned out, but we know when to expect it back. Only when something is lost and not replaced will something actually fall out of our collection.\nNetflix, like Hulu and others, appears to have struck deals with the studios that own the movies, television programs, etc., that grant time-limited access to the studios’ video vaults. If Netflix and the studio fail to come to an agreement for renewing their contract, all of that content becomes unavailable. Some of the materials themselves become unavailable after a certain time explicitly as part of the agreements. There is no certainty about when or if that content will become available again. With some studios, such as HBO, streaming rights are withheld for even longer time periods so that the pay-channel can recycle it in their lineup for a while, then hand it off to other cable channel licensees, and then maybe, eventually, it will come to streaming services.\nFaculty can’t teach with that kind of unknown variable, and I don’t blame them. That’s why libraries offer a reserves service to faculty. It helps to ensure that the materials will be available to patrons for the duration of the course, by more tightly controlling access with time and place limitations. Turning off access to course material in the middle of a term can be a significant, though not necessarily insurmountable, impediment to the curriculum. This is one reason, besides cost, that many libraries began acquiring VHS and then DVDs. Before costs dropped to make ownership viable, schools would rent films to be shown in class. Rental was not cheap, and the film would arrive and have to be sent back within a specific time frame. A lost or damage reel meant the next customer for that film could be out of luck.\nOwnership has a real advantage that cannot be understated. Unfortunately, I feel that we are likely to see the industry begin to shift back to a lease-based model with digital content, both to grow their regular income streams and also as a hedge against piracy. I worry for our library and our institution if that becomes the case.\nWhat are your thoughts about this?\n","date":"4 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-04-netflix-for-libraries-why-i-worry/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Netflix for Libraries? Why I Worry.","type":"posts"},{"content":"For the first time in 20 years, television set ownership dropped from 98.9 percent to 96.7 percent, according to The Nielsen Company (http://nyti.ms/ixHyhA). In the New York Times article, Nielsen attributes the decline to poverty and technology. In the latter case, Nielsen may soon redefine a “television household” to include Internet video viewers. You can read all that and more in the article, but I find this interesting for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, the poverty statistic is not particularly surprising, but worth addressing nonetheless. A few years ago, perhaps 7-8 years, it was time to buy a new TV. The “little” 19“ set was coming up short for connectivity and age. So, when Black Friday rolled around, we went shopping. Widescreen and HD sets were just starting to hit the mainstream market, but were still pricy. After all, I could get get a new 27” tube set for just over $100, whereas even a 19“ flat widescreen set, not even HD, was close to $300. That’s a lot of money for not much screen real estate. The wide aspect really makes a set feel small.\nFast forward a couple of years, and I found myself in line outside a Target store, again on Black Friday, finally thinking we could treat ourselves to an HD set\u0026hellip;if we could get our hands on one. We did, but even our new 37” 1080i set cost over $600. Even then I thought to myself, the whole scale of what should be a “reasonable price” for the family TV had shifted dramatically upward. Add to that, the shift to digital, the difficulty of even picking up local stations by antenna in rural areas (I’m in a somewhat rural city and I can’t pickup over-the-air stations), the rising cost of even basic cable service, and it’s not hard to see that “free” entertainment now has quite a high cost barrier to entry.\nThat dovetails with something I don’t see mentioned in the article, televisions per household. Replacing one TV to go digital is somewhat understandable and affordable. Replacing more than one at once, hurts the wallet even more. Convergence devices, such as smart phones, make a lot more sense if you are cash strapped. They’ve become The One Ring an individual or family can actually afford.\nTimes, and screens, have certainly changed. When I was thirteen, my parents gave me a choice between an “adult” bicycle and a television. I think my siblings received similar offers, but I was the first to get a color TV in my room (they received b\u0026amp;w sets). But this was huge, and it had nothing to do with television. In fact, since the living room TV had a cable box (it wasn’t even cable, just a single channel premium service), there was hardly a compelling reason not to watch TV there. No, for me, the television was a necessity in order to connect it to first my Commodore VIC-20 computer, and later my Commodore 64. That little 13“ set no longer functioned primarily as a television. It was my gateway to a whole new world, but I’ll leave that to a later posting.\nThe important thing is that multiple television sets in the house reduced competition for screen time among family members. It also ended up sending most of us to our respective rooms more and more. The VHS began to shift that dynamic some. TiVo and other DVR shifted that even more. Laptops, tablets and smart phones have taken it to perhaps its current extreme. When I was thirteen, I was the first person in my house for whom the TV became a monitor. Now, in just about every room of the house, monitors have become the new TVs. But, it has also, oddly, brought us back together in one room, even if we all might be looking at our personal screens, while the main set provides a shared ”background“ noise.\nKnowing that Nielsen has been tracking Internet usage for a number of years now, I’m actually quite surprised that they are just now considering redefining their “television household” terminology. That sounds so\u0026hellip;I don’t know, quaint. I think the cord to that notion should have be cut several years ago.\n","date":"3 May 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-05-03-whither-the-tv/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Whither the TV?","type":"posts"},{"content":"In our media center you’ll find VHS tapes, DVDs, CDs, audio, microfiche and the hardware needed to access these resources, which support the academic inquiry that takes place among our students and faculty across a wide breadth of campus disciplines. On our library shelves you’ll find a growing collection of manga, comic books, and graphic novels also supporting a diverse, though smaller, group of faculty and students. What you won’t find in our library or media center are video games, which are also being studied more and more by students and faculty on our campus in a number of disciplines\u0026ndash;media studies, English, music, women and gender studies, and computer science to name a few.\nAccording to an NPD study in 2007, 72% of American reported playing video games, up from 64% in 2006 (http://www.military.com/entertainment/games/game-news/70-percent-of-americans-play-video-games). In 2010, twenty percent, or some 56.8 million American reported playing video games on a social network, such as Facebook. (http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_100823.html). If nearly three-quarters of our population is engaged in playing video games, it only makes sense that, as an academic institution, we begin to commit resources to support further academic study of this activity, doesn’t it?\nI’d like to see us collect games the way we collect DVDs. We should pick up a couple of game systems as well but, of course, we’ll need to rethink our spaces in order to provide a suitable playing environment, so that game players don’t swing a controller into the person sitting in another booth trying to watch a DVD. We’ll probably have to rethink our loan policy, too. While a movie can be polished off in 2 hours, a video game can take 10-20 hours or more to finish.\nOf course, there are other issues to consider:\nConsoles and games on disc are great for now, but can we depend on them to be accessible in 5, 10, 20 years? Will they still be playable? Digital distribution is really taking off, from companies like Steam, Direct2Disc, and others for PC games, and of course there are digital downloads available for Microsoft’s XBOX 360, the Sony Playstation 3, and Nintendo’s DS and Wii consoles. How will we catalog a digital game that downloads and installs on library owned systems, as opposed to a physical disc? We can already catalog digital documents, but games are a trickier business. Speaking of digital distribution, I really like the approach taken by Good Old Games, gog.com. They take older games, make sure all the updates and patches are applied, and then make sure the games will run on Windows XP and Windows 7 PCs. When the games are purchased, you can download and install them at your leisure. Even better, they are released with none of the DRM (digital rights management) code that so often hobbles older games when the parent company no longer supports it. The games can be archived to your own disc and reinstalled at any time. That’s a model that I think would work well in the library. With so much e-commerce finding its way into the games themselves, I anticipate some problems or issues with making library “accounts” available for free-play usage in the LIbrary. I’m thinking that “parental controls” will need to be put in place. For academic inquiry, I’d really like to see game studios either begin to publish or allow others to publish scripts to their more narrative properties. I don’t mean novelizations, or walkthrough guides, but actual game scripts. That is a rich resource waiting to be plumbed. While I’m dreaming, an auto-play feature would be nice, too. But with the open world experiences found on many games, I don’t see that as realistic. I’m sure that I am missing other considerations. What’s happening on your campus?\nI expect to revisit this topic again in the future, and will likely write about other aspects of gaming in the academy as part of this blog.

He’s had a hand in all of them, either directly or indirectly as an investor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito).\nI’ve been reading and following Ito for several years, in magazines, on Twitter and online in other outlets. Is it sad or just representative of my Japanophilia that Guy Kawasaki, John Maeda, and Joi Ito are some of the first people who come to mind when I think of interesting and inspirational leaders in the tech world (Yes, I know that Ito is the only native Japanese of the three, and that Kawasaki and Maeda are both American). Nevertheless, I am as interested in Ito’s appointment as I was when John Maeda took the reins as President of the Rhode Island School of Design.\nMy particular interest in Ito, though, is his role as leading advocate for the Open Source Initiative, Creative Commons and for the sharing economy in general. In academia, one of the biggest challenges we have in preserving, creating and advancing intellectual discourse in the 21st century is dealing with the issues of copyright, ownership, rights management and the like.\nLibraries are prevented from preserving our film and photo heritage because copyright issues prevent them from transferring content to new formats. Our history is literally rotting away in cans and we are helpless to preserve it.\nStudents create academic research projects for courses using images, sound and video and cannot share them outside of the class, or run the risk of having their work silenced or removed under the scythe of overly broad takedown notices. The DMCA makes students, faculty and academic staff feel like criminals just for the act of excerpting video from DVDs for commentary and intellectual discussion.\nOur current copyright and patent system is broken and is in great need of revision that benefits the society at large and not just the corporations who are writing the laws through their lobbying efforts. Much more can be written on the subject certainly, but I’ll stop for now.\nSuffice it to say that MIT has been at the forefront of the open education movement for years, so I am greatly pleased to see Joi Ito come on board at the MIT Media Lab.

I’ve been asking for some time now, is it possible to have one media content system that does what we all want it to do?\nIn short, here are some of the key desired features:\nit needs both public and private options per media object. it needs to have course limited access to certain content it needs to have role-based publishing (faculty can post for students, students can post for courses, groups can publish for groups) it needs to be able to ingest some materials in a quasi-automatic way, such as for classroom lecture capture it needs to have a way of permitting time-defined playback (playing back only 30 sec. of a 2 min. clip, for example) OR it needs to allow for users to excerpt, edit or mashup it needs to have time-delimited playback (available from, available until), set by the user it needs to have generally universal playback (Mac, Windows, Linux, plus mobile) it needs to allow for rich metadata for long-term data storage and retrieval purposes within the metadata, it should accommodate rights management information it needs to integrate with our identity management system it needs to integrate with our learning management system Oh, and of course it should be easy-to-use. So, could there possibly be one platform that does all that? Or should we be looking at multiple products?\nSo, what is happening on your campus? What are the defined needs for you?\n","date":"28 April 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-04-28-one-media-platform-to-rule-them-all/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"One Media Platform to Rule Them All?","type":"posts"},{"content":"I had an interesting conversation with a colleague yesterday about the use or, more specifically, about the choice to use media in a traditional research paper. Just because we can include media content, should we? Why not? There are conventions to include outside text when a writer is commenting on it. For years, before it was easy to simply cut-and-paste an image into a paper, the challenge for a writer who chose to discuss an image, a sound or a videoclip was to adequately convey through words alone the content of that piece of media to the audience. Now, with digital publishing, an essay can include not only still images, but video and sound as well. We should encourage more digital publishing with just this kind of rich media, shouldn’t we?\nAnd, that’s where it gets complicated, on a number of levels. Three that crop up in particular are selection, inclusion, and citation.\nThe first challenge is in the act of selecting content to use. I think it can be reasonably argued that this is primarily an academic issue, one that teachers and professors should be responsible for in educating their students. It many ways this is no different from selecting text. Certainly, by taking the media description burden away from writers we may be depriving them of an opportunity to build their linguistic skills, but the media doesn’t stand on its own. It still needs to be properly included in the flow of the essay. My comment to my colleague was that the downside of a text description alone is that the author is filtering elements of the media in such a way as to be potentially deceptive about the actual content. This can be done with text, too, but there is at least a formal convention to indicate when a passage of text is quoted with words removed. The reply back, however, was that the media work itself may already be a filtered or doctored presentation. What is happening beyond the frame of the image? With Photoshop and digital manipulation, how much authenticity does the actual media object possess? Beyond that, to what degree does the use of certain media work against the research argument itself? In writing about exploitative images or gratuitous violence, would the inclusion of such examples strengthen or weaken the argument and be complicit in the exploitation? In the service of academic discourse, perhaps these are some of the questions we should be asking our students to consider. It’s complicated, and worthy of much more discussion than I can give it here, but more of a pedagogical issue.\nOnce the items are selected, though, the next challenge is in including the media objects within a research paper. I’m using the word “paper” here, even though it may actually never be printed. Rather than pedagogical, this barrier is more of a technical one. Students, for the most part, already know how to cut-and-paste images, and many of them know how to include web links to online resources. Including audio and video files can be more of an impediment. Linking to an external video source, such as on YouTube, does not usually provide a suitable means of “excerpting” a segment under discussion. Not to mention, there is a risk that any linked content could potentially disappear before the paper can reach its final audience. Learning how to extract a specific clip from a web video or a DVD is a skill that requires additional training and even puts students’ behavior potentially at odds with DMCA laws. Then, once the technical issues are overcome, there’s still a question of delivery. While many faculty are willing to accept student essays in electronic format, there is still often an expectation that the document will be printed. There is resistance to working with a document that is purely electronic. So again, it’s complicated.\nPerhaps the least complicated of the issues surrounds citation. After all, this is largely a matter of training. There are already guidelines for citation. However, as more and more students turn to the materials that are mixed, mashed and blended, they are often at a loss on how to properly identify the origins of the works they are choosing. The source materials themselves become the complicating factor.\nSo, do we continue to encourage using multi-media resources in traditional research papers? Can we afford not to do so? How best to proceed?\nI’d welcome your advice or suggestions.\n","date":"27 April 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-04-27-its-complicated-using-media-in-traditional-research-papers/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"It's Complicated: Using Media in Traditional Research Papers","type":"posts"},{"content":"The footnote (or endnote) is a great device in scholarly writing. Not only does it help to clarify the source of external passages or ideas, but it does so very unobtrusively via a superscripted number or character. Of course, more and more today we see references embedded directly within text, but they are minimal enough to simply breeze right by them without interrupting the flow of the passage. This is brilliant! We really need something like this for video. Some will say that is what the end credit are for, but I\u0026rsquo;m talking about something different.\nI recently had the opportunity to watch a video created by students for a writing course. The video was a mix of original recorded video and voiceover along with numerous clips off of YouTube. Afterwards, there was a perception by some in the audience that the video represented a collection of student-collated materials. It was, just not to the level that it appeared. A quick search immediately turned up the clips from YouTube that the student had appropriated.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t that the students used YouTube video, it was more that the students took videos that were already cut together by someone else into a narrative, and then used that narrative in their own work. Watching the video, you were never certain where the students\u0026rsquo; ideas ended and the YouTube poster\u0026rsquo;s ideas began. There was no clear \u0026ldquo;footnote\u0026rdquo; within the video. Even if the clips were cited in the credits, the problem still exists.\nEnd credits are more similar to a bibliography rather than to footnotes or endnotes. The bibliography simply lists all reference sources, while footnotes give more detailed information about materials obtained from others. Where is the video from? How much time did you use? What time excerpt did you use?\nWith more and more students being asked to create video and multimedia projects as part of their academic research, we really need to devise a standard of citation to use within these projects. We need something that is not merely a \u0026ldquo;slapping on\u0026rdquo; of traditional text-based citation mechanisms. Something with the elegance and detail of the footnote, but designed for video.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m imagining is a standard for a metadata layer that can be toggled on or off much like subtitles. This is better than a persistent on-screen citation because it stays out of the way during viewing, but can be validated when the work comes under more academic scrutiny. Although this could appear in the lower-third of the screen, I feel it needs to be off the screen entirely, in a sidebar or a drawer-like area that can be opened or closed. On-screen, not only does it interfere with the video, but it also runs the risk of being overwritten by ads in the current free-to-post model of online video hosting services.\nWhat do you think? Does this already exist? Give me some feedback or point me in the right direction.\n","date":"26 April 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-04-26-solution-wanted-footnoting-a-video/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Solution Wanted: Footnoting a Video","type":"posts"},{"content":"mon•tage: n. the technique of combining in a single composition pictorial elements from various sources, as parts of different photographs or fragments of printing, either to give the illusion that the elements belonged together originally or to allow each element to retain its separate identity as a means of adding interest or meaning to the composition.\nWhen I was a child in the 1970s, the montage that I could create of the world through mass media was from a limited number of inputs. My mom loved books, so there were always plenty of those around, and we always had subscriptions to the local paper and a variety of magazines. We had a television that received usually 4 VHF channels (ABC, NBC, CBS, and PBS) and between two and five local UHF channels depending on where we were living, and on how much you could play with the antenna and the fine tuning control. Music, except for the musical variety shows on TV, came via the radio and the 45s and LP in my mom’s and siblings’ record collections \\[I still can’t quite recall when I bought my first record\\]. Movies were something you had to catch while they were in theaters, because it could take years to show up, edited and censored, on network television. Until the late 70s, the only games I played were board games. I can remember though when those red LED handheld sports games were starting to take off in popularity, especially the football version. Video games lived at the pizza joint, the movie theater lobby, or the roller rink, and did not enter our home until my parents bought my brother a Sears rebranded Pong console. Cable television came much later for us.\nToday, the inputs for my “media montage” are decidedly more diverse, a buffet compared to the “set meal” of my youth. From the comfort of my sofa, I can see my hdtv on a stand that also holds a DVR cable box, an XBox 360, a Nintendo Wii, a DVD player, and a Roku set-top box. Beside me are my iPad and iPod Touch, and of course the MacBook on which I type this. Except for the TV and the DVD player, all of these devices are multi-media access devices. I can play an almost unlimited number of games; watch movies, videos and television shows; chat with friends; and I can even chat with my friends WHILE we are watching or playing the same program or game on three continents. I can pull up local, national and international news. I can access the current weather forecast in locations as diverse as New York, Walla Walla and Katmandu. If I want to hear a song, I can pull up the YouTube video version of it, enter the title into the Pandora channel on the Roku player, tune to one of many “music-only” channels on the cable box, or stream my personal music collection through the XBox. I can read a book and many magazines on the iPad, iPod Touch or MacBook. My montage is constantly changing and, more importantly, it is much more interactive.\nAs a child, I could turn the channel, literally, to see what else was on, but eventually I’d either find something or just stop turning the dial and complain, “there’s nothing on.” Then I’d settle on the sofa and passively watch the broadcast until I either grew bored or was called away to do something else. Now such passivity is rare. I’m actively curating what I watch; I’m sharing what I find with others; I’m joining the conversation about it through Twitter or Facebook. For news about the world, I have untold hundreds of reporters at my fingertips to give me all sides of the story. Even when I’m about to do some activity offline or IRL (in real life), I will often consult Internet resources, whether it’s for shopping, gardening, cooking, traveling, or playing the ukulele.\nI still buy, borrow and read books and magazines. I still buy music on discs (occasionally), though they are plastic and not vinyl. I still watch network television and go to theaters to watch movies. But those are just a portion of the rich media montage that I assemble for myself today. In my media montage there is always something “on” that I want to watch. Now, I am more selective of both my media and how I spend my time, but I would say that it all comes together quite nicely in the end.\n","date":"25 April 2011","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2011-04-25-whats-your-media-montage/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"What's your Media Montage?","type":"posts"},{"content":"Ever since I started watching Star Trek TNG I’ve been expecting (okay, hoping) to use the technology similar to that which arrived in my office a week ago, the Apple iPad. Well, the future may be here at last (except for my flying car, of course), but this jury of one is still out on the iPad. It is a device that I really want to love, and yet something holds me back. It is a device that I feel really does have a role to play, but not all niche fillers are runaway hits. I do believe that Apple will sell a ton of them and that they will thrive in the market, and that developers will continue to develop outstanding apps for them. I just don’t know if I’m ready to adopt one formally for my personal use.\nWhat’s the problem? Well\u0026hellip;size matters. And, in the case of the iPad, that is both its blessing and its curse. It’s the middle child, the Jan and Peter of Apple’s Brady Bunch of products. It the bizarro world version of Goldilocks’ chair, bed and porridge\u0026ndash;just right, and somehow not right at all. It wins by being both more portable than my MacBook (smaller, lighter and easier to carry) and more functional than my iPod Touch (larger, faster, easier to type). And yet, it fails, too, because I don’t see the iPad replacing either of the other two devices in my life. Maybe you can’t quite tell, but I’m having a real love-hate relationship with this product, despite the fact that it is so good in so many ways. Perhaps I need to take a more Zen approach and accept that the iPad way is the Middle Way of technological enlightenment.\nOkay, more precisely, the first generation iPad may be the first step on that particular path. It’s not slate-tech nirvana yet. Nevertheless, here are some of my first observations, based on the notes I’ve made to myself during this first week, along with some app reviews to round out the experience.\nThe standard iPad applications are fully functional and generally benefit from the larger screen size. One minor disappointment, though, is the Mail app. Others have noted this as well, but while I like the hovering mail and folder navigation, I would prefer not to have the last mail message read be the default entry point for the application. Take me to a folder or list view, please. I want to be able to close out of reading my mail messages without exiting the application.\nPages is a beautifully designed and very functional word processing and page layout application. Period. However, text input is still a chore without a physical keyboard (yes, I know a keyboard dock exists, as does Bluetooth, but at that point, give me a laptop!). Typing on the iPad is joy compared to the iPod Touch, since the added real estate benefits not only iPad native apps, but zoomed iPhone apps as well. That said, I desperately miss keyboard navigation keys, keyboard shortcuts, and even the Tab key. Also, a touch screen means no resting your fingers on the home keys.\nThe New York Times Editor\u0026rsquo;s Choice app and USA Today app offer great digital newspaper reading. The USA Today even includes quick polls that its readers can participate in and the New York Times free edition includes enough headline stories and photos to stay abreast of the latest events. Likewise, the BBC app has a nice mix of both text articles and live streaming audio. And the NPR for iPad application allows you to listen not only to favorite shows, but also broadcasts from your favorite NPR affiliate stations.\nThe Guardian Eyewitness application serves up visually rich, beautiful photos that look fantastic on the iPad screen.\nThe ABC Player is very good and the Netflix media player is at least satisfactory. I had some trouble with playback on the Netflix app, however, and navigating to watch multi-episode series was a bit of a chore. Sometimes the app would just crash back to the iPad main screen, but for the most part things went fine. Some queue management features are not available in the Netflix app, unfortunately, so reordering was a bit of a chore. This app will eventually work out its kinks though. I’m fairly confident of that. If anything, I think NBC and CBS need to get on the ball, or at least push Hulu to the iPad in short order. And while we\u0026rsquo;re at it, Tivo should release a stream player for the iPad as well.\nThe Marvel Comics app is beautiful. I like the option of reading page-by-page or in the more dramatic panel-by-panel mode. Unfortunately, I don’t see myself as a long-term customer. On the one hand, that comic consumption phase of my life has largely passed, and on the other, the comic world is much bigger than Marvel alone. Plus, how will comic collectors thrive in a world without sharing and trading?\nFor digital books, iBooks and GoodReader are must haves! iBooks takes the prize for a generally faithful reproduction of the book reading experience, minus the smell and feel of paper. Buying books online with iBooks is a snap, and sample chapters of books are also readily available. I’m sold on the idea that the iPad and technical books especially are a match made in heaven. If you are familiar with technical books, you know that they can weigh in at several pounds and 500-1000 pages, with color and text variations to differentiate narrative, code, and other highlights. The iPad’s ePub format presents the books perfectly without the excess weight and with no effort needed to keep the book opened to the desired page while you type out the code. I can’t tell you how often I search for something around my desk to keep pages from flipping on real books. GoodReader expands one’s digital library by allowing you to load up PDF documents to go. Again, the documents look great, even if the faux-book eyecandy of iBooks is missing here. To be fair, the heft of the iPad is considerably more than a Kindle, and a Kindle is much easier to read outside, but for visual reproduction, iPad is great. I’d liken the Kindle to a paperback in terms of portability and the iPad to a good hardcover. You may prefer to take the Kindle to the beach, but I read more at home and in the office, so the iPad works for me.\nI really need a cover for this device, something like the Kindle leatherette, but it needs to be thin, fold complete behind the device when open, have a kickstand, and perhaps the tilt-slant support option that Apple\u0026rsquo;s cover has, for typing on a desk or lap.\nOn the fun and games side of things, the extra screen real estate is a boon to game programmers, and older eyes, and a few of the first-to-store iPad games are quite entertaining. Harbor Master HD is a fun line drawing ship management game. Tap Tap Radiation, a tap-to-the-music game, is much easier for me to play on the larger screen that the Tap Tap Revolution games have been on the iPod Touch. I was really enjoying the match-three game Aurora Feint 3, which uses the tilt sensors to good effect in changing the game, until the in-game offer to BUY more lives popped up as I was about to die during a battle. I understand the need to make money through downloadable content (DLC), but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to spend a buck to add more lives to my game. My quarter-dropping arcade frustrations are years behind me. By far the most enjoyable game has been Mirror\u0026rsquo;s Edge for iPad. The developers have created a beautiful, easy-to-control, yet challenging side-scroller game. It costs more than I would have liked to spend, but it has been a lot of fun and a good example of where games can go on this platform.\nGoogle-PLEASE enable Google docs editing on iPad. This is the perfect cloud computing device, but you\u0026rsquo;re crippling it.\nWe know that multitasking is on its way, so that\u0026rsquo;s not even worth criticizing at this point, I feel. The only reason I wanted multitasking was so that I could have a persistent chat application open in the background, or a Twitter feed. Other than that I actually appreciated not being interrupted by push notification while reading a book or watching The IT Crowd on Netflix.\nSo, at week\u0026rsquo;s end what does it come down to? The iPad is a great device to have on the coffee table, the bedside table, in the car, in the kitchen and, potentially, in another room in the house where reading sometimes occurs. The size, portability, battery life, functionality and purpose are all perfectly aligned for this device to have a home in your home in these areas. I’ve used my laptop, iPod Touch, and even a netbook in all of these locations and I really feel that the iPad wins hands down in these arenas (with the exception that for some tasks that I do in the living room, such as writing this post, my laptop may actually be a better choice). The iPad is a great device for reading, surfing the Internet, watching movies, playing casual games, finding and using recipes, streaming audio, and mapping out a trip. Unfortunately, the iPad will not accompany me to the dentist\u0026rsquo;s and doctor\u0026rsquo;s office, at least not yet, and probably not ever if I do get around to trading in my iPod Touch for an iPhone. Also, the iPad will not soon replace my desktop or laptop for getting \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; work done. I bounce in and out of too many simultaneously open applications as I write and edit, and managing all of that is still easier and faster to do with a keyboard and mouse.\nAs Apple has done in the past, the iPad will likely reinvigorate the tablet computing market and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the competition from Android, in particular. For students, the iPad is a great starting point as textbooks go digital, and as more ruggedized incarnations appear I can see this form factor being a great alternative to the back-breaking volumes that K-12 students lug around. It will take some time for all of us to become comfortable and familiar with these devices, but I think it will happen, probably quite rapidly, and probably sooner than the appearance of my flying car.\n","date":"12 April 2010","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2010-04-12-typepad-7-days-with-ipad/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"7 Days with and iPad","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 April 2010","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/from-typepad/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"From Typepad","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2009","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/iphone/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"IPhone","type":"tags"},{"content":"(Ed. links removed since the apps no longer exist as they did back in 2009)\nI recently was asked to recommend iPhone apps for studying Japanese.

Leo Laporte\u0026rsquo;s TWiT network of \u0026ldquo;netcasts\u0026rdquo; and Patrick Norton\u0026rsquo;s DL.TV I was preparing for our annual sojourn back to Japan and decided to load up my Shuffle with some podcasts. I had been hearing so much about them but just had not made the time to listen. I had been a fan of Leo and the whole gang on TechTV, before G4 took over and killed most of the good stuff and, thanks to iTunes, I knew that their shows were available for subscription. So, in addition to my Audible book and a couple of CDs worth of music, I threw a couple of hours worth of podcasts onto my iPod.\nOn the flight over I listened to my book but finished it (it was a 12 hour flight afterall). Then on the train from Hiroshima to the ferry port to Miyajima I bypassed the music and tuned in to DL.TV (the audio version) and was hooked.

There has even been a kanji quiz with the audience a couple of years ago. At this event also a group of parents will also perform. In the past we have avoided participating merely because we did not have the time to practice. This year, almost by accident, we agreed to participate. So, three Saturdays ago we headed out to the Morimoto family home for an informal farewell to the Shinya family. After eating and talking for a while, a number of us gathered around the piano to begin singing. The song is an acapella version of Sakura by Naotaro Moriyama. Things went very well and last week we met after Saturday school for another practice. The number of participants increased and the harmony is starting to come together. And, I\u0026rsquo;m having fun.\n","date":"9 November 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-11-09-typepad-singing-again/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Singing Again","type":"posts"},{"content":"J. Angelo Racoma at Forever Geek pointed me in the direction of another blog at Restiffbard, and both deal with the simple difference in how Windows and Mac differ on a feature as simple as maximizing a window and how users operate given this behavior of the OS.\nFor those who may only have experience with one platform or the other, clicking the maximize button in the top right of a Windows window (next to the \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; close button) will make the active window fill the screen, completely obscuring everthing but the task bar. On a Macintosh, clicking the green maximize button in the top left of a window will zoom the window to maximally contain the contents of the window.\nI work on both platforms throughout the day, and although I\u0026rsquo;ve adapted to each, both behaviors please and aggravate me depending on the circumstance, though as a longer term Mac user, I am more accustomed to that platform\u0026rsquo;s approach. For me, in general, the primary reason I need to maximize any window is to see as much of the contents as will fit on the screen. Web-page too wide to fit the window? Maximize it. Document text slipping past the viewable margins? Maximize it. Zoomed photo not fitting? Maximize it. Scrolling through icons in a folder? Maximize it. And so on.\nBack when monitors were only 800 x 600, this behavior on either platform worked about the same. Now that we are at 1280 x 1024 standard and higher, the Windows version of this tends to annoy me more. The problem? I don\u0026rsquo;t need 4 inches of gray gutter around my documents in Word. I just want my document to fit the necessary space. The same with web pages, PDFs, and Windows Explorer. I do tend to multitask, with a number of windows in different applications open simultaneously and I am often comparing, copying, or referring to the contents of all of them, so I will often resize and position windows to accomodate this mode of working. At least once a day while on my PC I will accidentally hit the maximize button (or double-click the title bar) and BOOM, all windows save one are blocked. I know that clicking again will restore it, but I do find it frustrating, especially when the zoomed window invariably shows nothing but vast areas of white space.\nSo, when do I like the full-screen effect? When I am absolutely, positively working with a single application on a project requiring concentration. When I am reading a PDF on screen. And, when I am watching a DVD. In short, when I am uni-tasking. Except for the last one, that\u0026rsquo;s when the Mac maximize fails me, and it is click-and-drag-to-resize time.\nWhat about you?\nCheers, Kajiai\n","date":"22 September 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-09-22-typepad-reach-your-maximum/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How Do You Reach Your Maximum","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/macos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MacOS","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"22 September 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/windows/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Windows","type":"tags"},{"content":"Thunderous footsteps\nA sudden summer rainstorm\nTramples the daisies\n","date":"12 July 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-07-12-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-07-12","type":"posts"},{"content":"Timid spikes emerge\nFrom lavender snake-like heads\nAtop garden chives.\n","date":"25 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-25-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-25","type":"posts"},{"content":"Velvety green leaves\nA glimpse of scarlet stalks\nSoon a rhubarb pie!\n","date":"24 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-24-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-24","type":"posts"},{"content":"Neon shop sign\nLike new maple leaves outside\nRocking to and fro\n","date":"20 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-20-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-20","type":"posts"},{"content":"Mowing and trimming\nRain nourished dandelions\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the point, really?\nBold dandelions,\nBefore the mower blade, smile\nNow free to move on\n","date":"18 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-18-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-18","type":"posts"},{"content":"Bleeding hearts hanging\nLined up anticipating\nSummer sacrifice\n","date":"17 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-17-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-17","type":"posts"},{"content":"Each Spring youthfully\nWhite the crabapple awakes\nI, whiter each Fall\nCherry blossoms lie\nDropped like kimono at heel\nVirgin renewal\n","date":"16 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-16-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-16","type":"posts"},{"content":"Glassy reflections\nOf the gray-white sky shattered\nBy the pigeon\u0026rsquo;s strut\nPink and white blossoms\nConspire to keep me away\nFrom the red brick world\n","date":"15 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-15-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-15","type":"posts"},{"content":"Blueberry waffles\nBegin Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day at home\nShowers keep us in\n","date":"14 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-14-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-14","type":"posts"},{"content":"Chasing after her\nSpring rain soaks into the hem\nOf my denim jeans\n","date":"13 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-13-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-13","type":"posts"},{"content":"Now I find myself\nPushing pixels on screen while\nDogwood petals fall\n","date":"12 May 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2006-05-12-haiku/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"2006-05-12","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
